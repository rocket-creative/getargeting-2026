Conditional Knockout Mice: https://getargeting-2026.vercel.app/conditional-knockin-mice

	•	This page is OK, but it is pretty sparse. We can go live with it when it’s time, but we should flag or make a note that this needs to be added to. There are more types of conditional KI’s than just stop cassette conditional KI’s.

	•	That’s it for this page, overall really good.
