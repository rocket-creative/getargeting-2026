# **Glossary**

This glossary provides definitions of technical terms commonly used in mouse model generation and gene targeting. Understanding these terms helps researchers communicate effectively about their projects and interpret model capabilities.

Terms are organized alphabetically for easy reference. For more detailed information about specific technologies or model types, see our technology and model type pages.

## **A**

### **Allele**

A variant form of a gene. In gene targeting, alleles are created through genetic modification at the endogenous locus.

### **Antibiotic Selection Cassette**

A genetic element (e.g., NeoR, HygroR) inserted into targeting vectors to enable selection of successfully targeted ES cell clones.

### **Autosomal**

Refers to chromosomes other than sex chromosomes. Most genes are autosomal.

## **B**

### **BAC (Bacterial Artificial Chromosome)**

Large capacity cloning vector used for targeting very large genomic regions (up to 200kb).

### **Blastocyst**

Early stage embryo (E3.5) into which ES cells are injected to generate chimeric mice.

### **Breeding Scheme**

Plan for mating mice to generate desired genotypes, including heterozygote intercrosses, backcrosses, and conditional crosses.

## **C**

### **cDNA (Complementary DNA)**

DNA synthesized from mRNA template, containing only coding sequences without introns.

### **Chimeric Mouse**

Mouse containing cells derived from both injected ES cells and host blastocyst, identified by coat color contribution.

### **Conditional Allele**

Allele designed for controlled gene modification, typically using Cre lox or FLP FRT systems.

### **Cre Recombinase**

Enzyme that catalyzes recombination between loxP sites, enabling conditional gene modification.

### **Critical Exon**

Exon essential for gene function, typically targeted for deletion in knockout models.

## **D**

### **Derivative Allele**

Allele generated from an original targeted allele through recombinase mediated modification (e.g., tm1a, tm1b, tm1c, tm1d).

### **Doxycycline Inducible**

System for reversible control of gene expression using tetracycline transactivators and doxycycline administration.

## **E**

### **ES Cell (Embryonic Stem Cell)**

Pluripotent cells derived from early embryos, used for gene targeting through homologous recombination.

### **Exon**

Coding sequence within a gene that is included in mature mRNA after splicing.

## **F**

### **F1 Generation**

First filial generation, offspring of initial cross (e.g., chimeric mouse × wild type).

### **FRT Site**

34 base pair recognition sequence for FLP recombinase, used in FLP FRT system.

### **Floxed**

Refers to DNA sequence flanked by loxP sites, enabling conditional deletion via Cre recombinase.

## **G**

### **Gene Targeting**

Precise modification of genes at their endogenous chromosomal location using homologous recombination.

### **Germline Transmission**

Inheritance of targeted allele through gametes, confirmed by breeding chimeric mice.

### **Genotype**

Genetic composition of an organism, determined by PCR, Southern blot, or sequencing.

## **H**

### **Heterozygous**

Having one copy of a modified allele and one wild type copy.

### **Homologous Recombination**

Exchange of DNA sequences between targeting vector and chromosomal DNA at regions of sequence similarity.

### **Homozygous**

Having two copies of the same allele (either both modified or both wild type).

### **Humanization**

Replacement of mouse gene sequences with human orthologs to enable testing of human specific therapeutics.

## **I**

### **Inducible Expression**

Controlled gene activation or deletion at defined timepoints, typically using tamoxifen or doxycycline systems.

### **Intron**

Non coding sequence within a gene that is removed during RNA splicing.

## **K**

### **Knockin**

Precise insertion of genetic sequence at endogenous locus, including point mutations, reporters, or tags.

### **Knockout**

Inactivation of gene function through deletion or disruption of coding sequence.

## **L**

### **loxP Site**

34 base pair recognition sequence for Cre recombinase, used in Cre lox system.

## **M**

### **Microinjection**

Technique for introducing ES cells into blastocysts using fine glass needles.

## **N**

### **Null Allele**

Allele that completely eliminates gene function, creating a true knockout.

## **P**

### **Phenotype**

Observable characteristics resulting from genotype, including physical, biochemical, or behavioral traits.

### **Point Mutation**

Single nucleotide change in DNA sequence, used to model human disease variants.

### **Pre Germline Characterization**

Verification of allele structure in ES cells before mouse generation, including Southern blot and PCR analysis.

## **R**

### **Reporter Gene**

Visualization marker (e.g., LacZ, GFP) inserted to track gene expression or cell lineage.

### **Rosa26**

Safe harbor locus commonly used for transgene integration, providing ubiquitous expression.

## **S**

### **Safe Harbor Locus**

Genomic location suitable for transgene integration without disrupting endogenous gene function (e.g., Rosa26, HPRT, H11).

### **Southern Blot**

Molecular technique for verifying correct targeting and allele structure through DNA hybridization.

### **Strain Background**

Genetic background of mouse strain (e.g., C57BL/6, BALB/c) on which targeted alleles are maintained.

## **T**

### **Tamoxifen Inducible**

System for temporal control of gene deletion using CreERT2 and tamoxifen administration.

### **Targeting Vector**

DNA construct containing homology arms and genetic modifications, used for gene targeting via homologous recombination.

### **Tissue Specific**

Expression or modification restricted to defined cell types or organs, typically using tissue specific promoters.

## **W**

### **Wild Type**

Unmodified, natural form of a gene or organism, used as control in experiments.
