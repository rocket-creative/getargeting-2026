# Catalog Mouse Models
In addition to custom gene targeting and editing services, ingenious targeting laboratory maintains catalog models available for rapid shipment. These include humanized immune checkpoint mice for immuno-oncology research, Cre driver lines for conditional gene expression, and reporter strains for cell tracking and imaging.
Catalog models provide immediate access to study-ready strains without the timeline required for custom model generation. All catalog models are maintained under rigorous quality standards and shipped with complete documentation.
## Humanized Immune Checkpoint Mice
Humanized immune checkpoint models enable preclinical testing of human specific checkpoint inhibitor antibodies in immunocompetent mice. These models express human immune checkpoint proteins while maintaining functional mouse immune systems.
### Single Checkpoint Models
Individual checkpoint humanizations available include:
PD1 Humanized: Human PDCD1 extracellular domain for anti PD1 antibody testing
PDL1 Humanized: Human CD274 extracellular domain for anti PDL1 antibody testing
CTLA4 Humanized: Human CTLA4 extracellular domain for anti CTLA4 antibody testing
LAG3 Humanized: Human LAG3 extracellular domain for anti LAG3 antibody testing
TIM3 Humanized: Human HAVCR2 extracellular domain for anti TIM3 antibody testing
(/single-checkpoint-mice)
### Double Checkpoint Models
Combination checkpoint humanizations enable testing of dual checkpoint blockade approaches:
PD1/CTLA4 Double Humanized: For combination anti PD1 plus anti CTLA4 studies
PD1/LAG3 Double Humanized: For combination anti PD1 plus anti LAG3 studies
PD1/TIM3 Double Humanized: For combination anti PD1 plus anti TIM3 studies

## Cre Driver Lines
Cre driver lines express Cre recombinase in specific tissues or under inducible control. Crossing Cre drivers with floxed alleles enables tissue specific or temporally controlled gene deletion.
### Tissue Specific Cre Lines
Constitutive Cre drivers express Cre recombinase under tissue specific promoters. Available lines include drivers for liver, kidney, heart, brain, immune cells, and other tissues.
### Inducible Cre Lines
Tamoxifen inducible CreERT2 and doxycycline inducible rtTA Cre systems enable temporal control over Cre activity. These lines are available with various tissue specific or ubiquitous promoters.

## Reporter Lines
Reporter mice express fluorescent proteins, enzymatic markers, or other reporters under various promoter systems. These strains enable cell tracking, lineage tracing, and visualization of gene expression.
### Constitutive Reporters
Ubiquitous reporter expression enables cell labeling and tracking applications.
### Cre Dependent Reporters
Cre dependent reporters are activated only in cells expressing Cre recombinase, enabling fate mapping and lineage tracing when combined with tissue specific Cre drivers.
### Inducible Reporters
Inducible reporter systems enable temporally controlled labeling for pulse chase experiments and acute lineage tracing.

## Ordering Information
### Availability
Catalog models are maintained as breeding colonies or cryopreserved stocks. Contact us to confirm current availability and estimated ship dates.
### Shipping
Models are shipped as breeding pairs or cohorts depending on your requirements. Domestic and international shipping are available with appropriate documentation.
### Documentation
All catalog models include genotyping protocols, strain background information, and health documentation.
### Material Transfer
Standard material transfer agreements govern use of catalog models. Contact us to discuss licensing terms for commercial and academic applications.
## Custom Model Alternative
If catalog models do not meet your specific requirements, ingenious targeting laboratory generates custom knockout, knockin, and humanized models tailored specifically to your research goals. Custom projects include comprehensive documentation and ongoing technical support.

## Frequently Asked Questions
How do I know if a catalog model is available?
Contact ingenious targeting laboratory to confirm current availability. Catalog models are maintained as breeding colonies or cryopreserved stocks. Availability and estimated ship dates are provided upon inquiry. Some models may require recovery from cryopreservation.
What is included when I order a catalog model?
You will receive breeding pairs or cohorts (depending on your order), genotyping protocols, strain background information, and health documentation.
Can catalog models be customized or modified?
Catalog models are provided as-is. If you need modifications (different background, additional alleles, or custom changes), we recommend a custom model generation project. Custom projects can sometimes build upon existing catalog models to reduce timeline and cost.
How long does it take to receive catalog models?
Shipping timelines depend on availability. Contact us to determine the timeline for your specific model of interest.
What is the ingenious Catalog Library?
The Catalog Library includes 10,000+ mouse and rat models. These models are available for scientific use, and availability is confirmed upon request. Models available include humanized immune checkpoint mice for immuno-oncology research, Cre driver lines for conditional gene expression, and reporter strains for cell tracking and imaging.
