# Mouse Cryopreservation Services
Since 1998, Ingenious Targeting Laboratory has provided cryopreservation services to protect valuable genetically engineered mouse lines for researchers worldwide. Our cryopreservation expertise ensures your mouse models remain available for future research, protected against colony loss due to disease outbreak, breeding failure, or facility disruption.
Cryopreservation converts living mouse lines into stable frozen archives that can be stored indefinitely and recovered when needed. Whether preserving sperm for rapid archiving or embryos for maximum genetic preservation, cryopreservation provides insurance for your research investment and enables efficient management of mouse model resources.
Our facility maintains cryopreserved samples in liquid nitrogen storage with redundant systems and detailed inventory tracking. Combined with validated recovery protocols, cryopreservation services provide reliable long term preservation of your genetically engineered lines.
# Cryopreservation Options
## Sperm Cryopreservation
Sperm freezing provides rapid, cost effective line preservation:
Speed:** Samples collected and frozen within days
Efficiency:** Single male provides multiple preservation units
Cost:** Lower cost than embryo cryopreservation
Recovery:** IVF with wildtype oocytes regenerates line
Sperm cryopreservation is ideal for routine archiving of established lines and backup preservation of active breeding colonies.
## Embryo Cryopreservation
Embryo freezing preserves complete genotypes including homozygotes and complex allele combinations:
Genetic preservation:** Both maternal and paternal genotypes preserved
Homozygote recovery:** Frozen embryos can be homozygous
Complex genotypes:** Multi allele combinations preserved intact
Recovery:** Direct embryo transfer regenerates line
Embryo cryopreservation is preferred when preserving homozygous lines, compound mutants, or genotypes that would be difficult to regenerate through breeding.
## Choosing Between Methods
# Recovery Services
## IVF Recovery (from Sperm)
In vitro fertilization regenerates lines from cryopreserved sperm:
Thaw cryopreserved sperm samples
Fertilize wildtype oocytes in vitro
Transfer resulting embryos to pseudopregnant recipients
Genotype offspring to identify carriers
IVF recovery typically produces heterozygous offspring that can be intercrossed to regenerate homozygotes if needed.
## Embryo Transfer Recovery
Direct embryo transfer regenerates lines from cryopreserved embryos:
Thaw cryopreserved embryos
Transfer to pseudopregnant recipients
Pups born with preserved genotype
No additional breeding required for genotype recovery
Embryo transfer recovery is straightforward and regenerates the exact genotype that was frozen.
# Why Cryopreserve
## Protect Research Investment
Genetically engineered mouse models represent significant investment:
Time:**Many months for model generation
Cost:** Substantial project investment
Expertise:** Scientific design and characterization
Irreplaceable:** Unique alleles cannot be easily recreated
Cryopreservation protects this investment against unforeseen loss.
## Risk Mitigation
Live colonies face multiple risks:
Disease outbreak:** Pathogen introduction can require colony elimination
Breeding failure:** Lines can become infertile or lose vigor
Facility disruption:** Equipment failure, natural disaster, or relocation
Genetic drift:** Accumulated mutations over many generations
Human error:** Breeding mistakes or colony mismanagement
Frozen archives provide recovery options when live colonies are compromised.
## Resource Efficiency
Cryopreservation enables efficient resource management:
Reduce vivarium costs:** Archive inactive lines instead of maintaining live colonies
Free cage space:** Preserve lines not currently needed for experiments
Maintain options:** Keep valuable lines available without ongoing per diem costs
Share resources:** Distribute frozen samples to collaborators
## Publication and Grant Requirements
Many funding agencies and journals require or recommend line preservation:
NIH expects deposition of mouse resources
Journals may require availability statements
Collaborator access facilitated by frozen archives
Reproducibility supported by preserved lines
# Storage and Security
## Liquid Nitrogen Storage
Cryopreserved samples are maintained in liquid nitrogen at minus 196 degrees Celsius:
Samples remain viable indefinitely at this temperature
No biological activity or degradation occurs
Periodic liquid nitrogen replenishment maintains temperature
Automated monitoring systems alert to any issues
## Redundant Storage
Critical samples benefit from geographic redundancy:
Store backup samples at separate location
Protection against site specific disasters
Multiple recovery options if primary archive is compromised
## Inventory Management
Professional inventory tracking ensures sample accessibility:
Detailed records of all stored samples
Location tracking within storage system
Sample history and recovery documentation
Regular inventory audits
# Integration with Model Generation
## Archiving New Models
Cryopreservation integrates seamlessly with model generation projects:
Archive germline confirmed founders as part of project completion
Preserve characterized ES cell clones for future use
Create backup before shipping live animals
Establish archive before colony expansion
## Ongoing Colony Support
Cryopreservation supports active research programs:
Periodic backup of valuable breeding lines
Archive before planned colony reduction
Preserve intermediate genotypes during complex breeding
Create distribution archives for collaborator requests

## Frequently Asked Questions
What is the difference between sperm cryopreservation and embryo cryopreservation?
Sperm cryopreservation freezes sperm from male mice. To recover the line, frozen sperm is used for IVF with wildtype oocytes. Embryo cryopreservation freezes two-cell embryos. Recovery involves thawing and transferring embryos to surrogate females. Sperm is faster and less expensive; embryos preserve maternal genetics and produce animals more quickly.
How long can frozen samples remain viable?
Samples stored in liquid nitrogen at -196°C remain viable indefinitely. There is no biological activity or degradation at this temperature. Properly stored samples have been successfully recovered after decades of storage.
How many straws or embryos should I archive?
For adequate insurance, we typically recommend archiving sperm from 2-3 males (yielding 10-20 straws) or 100-200 embryos. This provides multiple recovery attempts if needed. For particularly valuable lines, redundant storage at geographically separate locations is recommended.
How long does it take to recover a line from cryopreserved material?
Sperm recovery via IVF requires 4-6 weeks to produce live pups, plus breeding time to establish a colony. Embryo recovery requires 3-4 weeks. Recovery timelines depend on recipient availability and embryo/sperm quality.
Can you cryopreserve lines with complex genotypes (multiple alleles)?
Yes. For lines with multiple alleles or complex genotypes, embryo cryopreservation is preferred because it preserves the exact genotype. Sperm cryopreservation only preserves the male genome and requires breeding to reconstruct complex genotypes.

| Advantage | Consideration |
