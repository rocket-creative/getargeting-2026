# Cardiovascular Mouse Models
Since 1998, ingenious targeting laboratory has supported cardiovascular research with custom mouse models enabling mechanistic studies of atherosclerosis, heart failure, hypertension, and other cardiovascular diseases that represent leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide.
Cardiovascular mouse models provide essential platforms for investigating the molecular mechanisms underlying vascular disease, testing hypotheses about lipid metabolism and inflammation, and developing therapies targeting cardiovascular risk factors and disease pathways.
## The Challenge of Cardiovascular Disease Modeling
Cardiovascular diseases encompass a diverse range of conditions affecting the heart and blood vessels. Mouse models must capture relevant aspects of human disease while accounting for important species differences in cardiovascular physiology and lipid metabolism.
### Species Considerations
Mice differ from humans in several cardiovascular relevant ways:
Lipid Metabolism
Mice carry most cholesterol in HDL rather than LDL, making them naturally resistant to atherosclerosis. Genetic modifications disrupting ApoE or LDLR function are typically required to create hypercholesterolemia and vascular disease.
Heart Rate and Size
Mouse hearts beat approximately 600 times per minute compared to 60 to 100 in humans. Cardiac remodeling processes may differ due to these physiological differences.
Coronary Anatomy
Mouse coronary arteries are small and follow different branching patterns than human coronaries. Spontaneous coronary atherosclerosis is rare even in hyperlipidemic models.
### Choosing the Right Model System
Different cardiovascular questions require different modeling approaches:
Atherosclerosis Studies
Hyperlipidemic backgrounds (ApoE knockout, LDLR knockout) combined with dietary or genetic modifications targeting specific pathways.
Heart Failure Studies
Surgical interventions (TAC, MI), genetic cardiomyopathy models, or aging combined with metabolic stress.
Hypertension Studies
Angiotensin system modifications, renal models, or genetic approaches targeting blood pressure regulatory pathways.
## Model Types for Cardiovascular Research
### Atherosclerosis Models
Atherosclerosis modeling requires hyperlipidemic backgrounds that develop vascular lesions:
ApoE Knockout
The most widely used atherosclerosis model. ApoE deficiency causes severe hypercholesterolemia and spontaneous atherosclerosis that accelerates on Western diet. Lesions develop in the aortic root, brachiocephalic artery, and other large vessels.
LDLR Knockout
LDL receptor deficiency requires Western diet to develop significant hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis. This model more closely resembles human familial hypercholesterolemia and is sensitive to dietary intervention.
ApoE/LDLR Double Knockout
Combined deficiency produces more severe hyperlipidemia and accelerated atherosclerosis. Useful when aggressive lesion development is required.
Conditional Atherosclerosis Models
Tissue specific or inducible deletion of atherosclerosis modifying genes on hyperlipidemic backgrounds enables dissection of cell type specific contributions to disease.

### Heart Failure and Cardiomyopathy Models
Genetic models complement surgical approaches for heart failure research:
Sarcomeric Protein Mutations
Knockin mice expressing mutations in MYH7, MYBPC3, TNNT2, and other sarcomeric genes model hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathies. These models enable study of mutation specific disease mechanisms and therapeutic testing.
Signaling Pathway Modifications
Knockout or overexpression of genes in calcium handling, beta adrenergic signaling, or metabolic pathways produce cardiac phenotypes ranging from hypertrophy to heart failure.
Conditional Cardiac Models
Cardiomyocyte specific Cre drivers (alphaMHC Cre, cTNT Cre) enable cardiac specific gene manipulation without systemic effects.
### Hypertension Models
Blood pressure regulation involves multiple organ systems:
Renin Angiotensin System
Knockout or overexpression of angiotensinogen, renin, ACE, or angiotensin receptors enables study of this central blood pressure regulatory system.
Renal Sodium Handling
Modifications to ENaC, WNK kinases, and other renal sodium transporters affect blood pressure through volume regulation.
Vascular Tone Regulators
eNOS knockout and other vascular modifying genes affect peripheral resistance and blood pressure.
### Lipid Metabolism Models
Understanding lipid handling is central to cardiovascular disease:
Lipoprotein Metabolism
Knockout or humanization of apolipoproteins, lipoprotein receptors, and lipid transfer proteins enables study of cholesterol and triglyceride metabolism.
Hepatic Lipid Handling
Liver specific knockouts of genes involved in lipid synthesis, storage, and export reveal hepatic contributions to systemic lipid levels.
Reverse Cholesterol Transport
ABCA1, ABCG1, SR-BI, and other genes involved in HDL metabolism and cholesterol efflux influence atherosclerosis susceptibility.
## Model Design Considerations
### Background Strain Selection
Cardiovascular phenotypes are strongly influenced by genetic background:
C57BL/6
Susceptible to atherosclerosis and diet induced metabolic dysfunction. The most common background for cardiovascular studies. However, C57BL/6J carries the Nnt mutation affecting glucose metabolism.
BALB/c
Relatively resistant to atherosclerosis compared to C57BL/6. May be useful for studies requiring less aggressive disease progression.
DBA/2
Distinct cardiac phenotypes and response to cardiac stress compared to C57BL/6. Consider for specific cardiac physiology studies.
129
ES cell donor strains carry varying degrees of 129 background that can influence cardiovascular phenotypes. Backcrossing to pure backgrounds eliminates these effects.

### Achieving Clinically Relevant Phenotypes
Several strategies enhance translational relevance:
Dietary Intervention
Western diet (high fat, high cholesterol) accelerates atherosclerosis and metabolic dysfunction. Diet composition significantly affects phenotype severity.
Aging
Many cardiovascular phenotypes require aging for full development. Plan studies with appropriate timelines for aged cohorts.
Combined Risk Factors
Combining genetic modifications (e.g., hyperlipidemia plus hypertension) can produce more severe or clinically relevant phenotypes.
Sex as a Variable
Cardiovascular disease incidence and mechanisms differ between sexes. Include both male and female cohorts and analyze sex specific effects.
### Tissue Specific Approaches
Cardiovascular diseases involve multiple cell types and tissues:
Cardiomyocyte Specific
alphaMHC Cre or cTNT Cre drive recombination in cardiac muscle for heart specific studies.
Vascular Endothelium
Tie2 Cre, VE Cadherin Cre, or Cdh5 CreERT2 target endothelial cells throughout the vasculature.
Vascular Smooth Muscle
SM22 Cre or SMA Cre target vascular smooth muscle cells for studies of vessel wall biology.
Myeloid Cells
LysM Cre targets macrophages and other myeloid cells that contribute to atherosclerosis and cardiac inflammation.
Hepatocyte Specific
Albumin Cre targets hepatocytes for studies of liver lipoprotein metabolism and its systemic effects.

### Complex Cardiovascular Model Design
Many cardiovascular studies require sophisticated genetic systems:
Conditional Deletion on Hyperlipidemic Background
Floxed alleles crossed to ApoE or LDLR knockout backgrounds enable atherosclerosis studies with cell type specific gene deletion.
Inducible Cardiac Models
Tamoxifen inducible cardiomyocyte Cre (alphaMHC CreERT2) enables temporal control of cardiac gene deletion, avoiding developmental effects.
Reporter Integration
Fluorescent reporters in cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells, or smooth muscle enable lineage tracing and cell population identification.
Humanized Targets
Human gene expression enables testing of therapeutic antibodies or compounds designed for human targets.

## Frequently Asked Questions
What Cre drivers are used for cardiovascular research?
Common cardiovascular Cre drivers include Myh6-Cre (cardiomyocytes), Tie2-Cre (endothelial cells), SM22-Cre (smooth muscle cells), and alphaMHC-CreERT2 (inducible cardiomyocyte). Selection depends on whether you're studying cardiac, vascular, or combined cardiovascular phenotypes.
Can I study atherosclerosis with genetically engineered models?
Yes. Atherosclerosis models typically combine conditional gene modifications with hyperlipidemic backgrounds (ApoE knockout or LDLR knockout). For example, macrophage-specific knockouts on ApoE-/- background enable study of how specific genes affect plaque formation and inflammation.
What cardiovascular phenotyping assays are available?
Standard assays include echocardiography (cardiac function), blood pressure measurement (tail cuff or telemetry), exercise testing (treadmill), and vascular function (wire myography). More specialized assays include cardiac MRI, pressure-volume loops, and isolated heart perfusion.
How do I model heart failure in mice?
Heart failure models can involve cardiomyocyte-specific knockouts of contractile proteins, inducible cardiac gene deletion in adults, or pressure overload (TAC surgery). Conditional systems enable temporal control to avoid developmental defects while studying adult cardiac function.
What is the advantage of inducible cardiac models?
Tamoxifen-inducible Cre systems (e.g., alphaMHC-CreERT2) enable gene deletion in adult cardiomyocytes after normal development is complete. This avoids developmental compensation and allows study of acute gene loss effects on adult cardiac function, better modeling acquired heart disease.
