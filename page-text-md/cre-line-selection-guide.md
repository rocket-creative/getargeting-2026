# Cre Line Selection Guide
Selecting the appropriate Cre driver line is critical for successful conditional knockout experiments. Since 1998, Ingenious Targeting Laboratory has created over 2,500 models, including Cre driver lines, specific to your research projects.
This guide helps researchers navigate Cre line selection by tissue specificity, expression timing, recombination efficiency, and experimental requirements. Proper Cre selection ensures gene deletion occurs in the intended cell population with appropriate temporal control.
## Key Selection Criteria
### Tissue Specificity
Tissue specific Cre lines restrict recombination to defined cell populations:
Cell Type Specificity**: Deletion only in target cell type
Organ Specificity**: Deletion throughout entire organ
Regional Specificity**: Deletion in specific anatomical regions
Developmental Stage**: Expression timing during development
Consider whether your research requires cell type, organ, or regional specificity when selecting Cre lines.
### Expression Timing
Cre expression timing affects when gene deletion occurs:
Embryonic Expression**: Deletion from early development
Postnatal Expression**: Deletion after birth
Adult Expression**: Deletion in mature animals
Inducible Expression**: Deletion at defined timepoints
Match expression timing to your experimental requirements, especially when studying developmentally essential genes.
### Recombination Efficiency
Recombination efficiency varies between Cre lines:
High Efficiency**: Near complete deletion in target cells
Moderate Efficiency**: Partial deletion requiring verification
Variable Efficiency**: Efficiency differs between tissues
High efficiency Cre lines are preferred when complete gene deletion is required. Moderate efficiency lines may be acceptable when partial deletion is sufficient.
### Background Recombination
Some Cre lines show background recombination in unintended tissues:
Leaky Expression**: Low level recombination without induction
Off Target Expression**: Recombination in non target tissues
Germline Recombination**: Deletion in gametes
Consider background recombination when interpreting phenotypes, especially for inducible Cre systems.
## Major Cre Line Categories
### Nervous System Cre Lines
Neuroscience research uses diverse Cre lines for cell type specific studies:
(/neuroscience-mouse-models)
### Immune System Cre Lines
Immunology research requires precise immune cell targeting:
(/immunology-mouse-models)
### Metabolic Tissue Cre Lines
Metabolic research uses tissue specific Cre lines for organ restricted studies:
(/metabolic-disease-mouse-models)
## Inducible Cre Systems
### Tamoxifen Inducible Cre (CreERT2)
CreERT2 provides temporal control over gene deletion:
Tissue Specific CreERT2**: Spatial and temporal control
Ubiquitous CreERT2**: Temporal control only
Induction Timing**: Deletion at defined timepoints
Reversibility**: Permanent deletion after induction
Tamoxifen inducible systems are ideal when gene deletion timing is critical, such as modeling disease onset or studying adult gene function.

### Other Inducible Systems
Additional inducible systems provide alternative temporal control:
Doxycycline Inducible**: Reversible expression control
Heat Shock Inducible**: Acute induction
Light Inducible**: Optogenetic control
## Selection Workflow
### Step 1: Define Target Cell Population
Identify the specific cell type or tissue where gene deletion is required. Consider whether cell type, organ, or regional specificity is needed.
### Step 2: Determine Expression Timing
Decide when gene deletion should occur. Embryonic deletion for developmental studies, postnatal for adult function, or inducible for temporal control.
### Step 3: Evaluate Recombination Efficiency
Assess whether high efficiency deletion is required or if moderate efficiency is acceptable. Consider verification methods for recombination efficiency.
### Step 4: Check Background Recombination
Review literature for reported background recombination in unintended tissues. Consider controls to assess off target effects.
### Step 5: Verify Cre Line Availability
Confirm Cre line availability from repositories or consider custom Cre line generation if standard lines don't meet requirements.
## Common Selection Mistakes
### Overly Broad Specificity
Selecting Cre lines with broader expression than needed can complicate phenotype interpretation. Choose the most specific Cre line that meets requirements.
### Ignoring Expression Timing
Failing to consider when Cre expression begins can lead to unexpected developmental phenotypes. Match expression timing to experimental goals.
### Insufficient Efficiency Verification
Not verifying recombination efficiency can lead to misinterpretation of negative results. Always include reporter alleles or PCR verification.
## Resources
### Cre Line Databases
Several catalog available Cre lines:
Jackson Laboratory Cre Repository
MGI Cre Line Database
Cre Line Publications
### Custom Cre Line Generation
If standard Cre lines don't meet requirements, Ingenious Targeting Laboratory can generate custom Cre specific to your experimental goals.

## Frequently Asked Questions
How do I verify that a Cre driver line works correctly before using it?
Cross the Cre driver to a reporter line (Rosa26-tdTomato or Rosa26-LacZ) before experimental crosses. This visualizes the recombination pattern and confirms expected tissue distribution and timing. Also verify Cre expression by immunohistochemistry and monitor genotyping for unexpected recombination in control tissues.
What is the difference between tissue-specific and inducible Cre drivers?
Tissue-specific Cre drivers provide spatial control (gene deleted in specific organs from development). Inducible Cre drivers (CreERT2) provide temporal control (gene deleted at specific times via tamoxifen). Tissue-specific CreERT2 drivers combine both, providing maximum control with spatial and temporal specificity.
What causes mosaic recombination and how can I improve it?
Mosaic recombination (incomplete deletion in target tissue) can result from weak Cre expression, late onset of expression, or inaccessible chromatin at the floxed locus. To improve recombination efficiency, choose stronger or more established Cre drivers, use homozygous floxed alleles (increases recombination probability), or use inducible systems for more complete activation.
How do I avoid germline recombination?
Germline recombination occurs when Cre is active in germ cells, causing global deletion in all offspring. To avoid this, choose Cre drivers without reported germline activity, maintain Cre on one gender only (maternal vs paternal inheritance), monitor genotyping for unexpected global deletion patterns, and review literature for germline activity reports for your chosen Cre driver.
What should I consider when selecting a Cre driver for conditional knockout experiments?
Key considerations include: specificity (expression limited to target cell type), expression level (sufficient for complete recombination), developmental timing (when expression begins affects which cells are targeted), background recombination (off-target activity in unintended tissues), and recombination efficiency (complete vs mosaic deletion). Always verify with reporter crosses before experimental use.
