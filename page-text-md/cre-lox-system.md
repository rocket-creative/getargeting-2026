# Cre Lox System
Since 1998, Ingenious Targeting Laboratory has completed over 2,500 knockout projects, including conditional, using the Cre lox system. Our Cre lox based models have supported research published in more than 800 peer reviewed journals including Science, Nature, Cell, enabling tissue specific and temporally controlled gene manipulation across every organ system.
The Cre lox system is the foundation of conditional gene targeting in mice. By flanking critical gene elements with LoxP sites, researchers create alleles that function normally until exposed to Cre recombinase. Crossing floxed mice to tissue specific or inducible Cre driver lines enables gene deletion in defined cell populations or at specific times, providing experimental control not possible with conventional knockouts.
This technology has transformed mouse genetics by enabling study of essential genes that cause embryonic lethality when deleted globally, dissection of gene function in specific tissues without confounding systemic effects, and temporal control over gene inactivation to model disease onset or acute loss of function.
## How Cre Lox Works
### The Components
The Cre lox system consists of two components that work together:
Cre recombinase is a 38 kDa enzyme from bacteriophage P1 that catalyzes recombination between specific DNA sequences. Cre recognizes and binds to LoxP sites, bringing two sites together and catalyzing strand exchange to excise or invert the intervening DNA.
LoxP sites are 34 base pair DNA sequences consisting of two 13 bp inverted repeats flanking an 8 bp asymmetric spacer. The spacer sequence determines directionality. When two LoxP sites are oriented in the same direction, Cre mediated recombination excises the intervening sequence, leaving a single LoxP site.
### Recombination Outcomes
The relative orientation of LoxP sites determines the recombination outcome:
Same orientation (direct repeats):** Excision of intervening sequence, leaving single LoxP site
Opposite orientation (inverted repeats):** Inversion of intervening sequence
Different chromosomes or distant sites:** Translocation or large deletion (less efficient)
For conditional knockout applications, LoxP sites are positioned as direct repeats flanking critical exons. Cre mediated excision removes the exons, creating a null allele.
### Conditional Knockout Mechanism
In a conditional knockout (floxed) allele:
LoxP sites flank one or more critical exons
The floxed allele functions normally in the absence of Cre
Gene expression, splicing, and protein function are preserved
When Cre is expressed, the floxed exons are excised
Excision creates a null allele in Cre expressing cells
Cells without Cre retain normal gene function
This design enables gene inactivation restricted to specific cell types, tissues, or developmental stages based on the Cre driver used.
## LoxP Site Design
### Positioning Considerations
Proper LoxP site placement is essential for conditional allele function:
Intronic placement:** LoxP sites are typically placed in introns to avoid disrupting gene expression before Cre exposure
Critical exon selection:** Flanked exons must be essential for gene function; their deletion should create a true null
Splice site preservation:** LoxP insertion should not disrupt normal splicing
Regulatory element avoidance:** Positioning should not interfere with enhancers or other regulatory sequences
### Exon Selection Criteria
The exon or exons flanked by LoxP sites must meet specific criteria:
Present in all known transcript variants
Encode essential functional domains
Deletion causes frameshift in downstream sequence (for single exon targeting)
No alternative splicing that could bypass the deletion
Ingenious Targeting Laboratory analyzes gene structure, transcript architecture, and protein domains to identify optimal exon targets for each project.

## Cre Driver Lines
### Tissue Specific Cre Expression
Tissue specificity is achieved through Cre driver lines that express Cre recombinase under tissue specific promoters. Hundreds of Cre driver lines are available, targeting virtually every organ system and cell type.

## Inducible Cre Systems
### Tamoxifen Inducible (CreERT2)
CreERT2 is a fusion of Cre recombinase with a modified estrogen receptor ligand binding domain. The fusion protein is sequestered in the cytoplasm until tamoxifen administration, which triggers nuclear translocation and Cre activity.
CreERT2 enables temporal control over gene deletion:
Gene deletion triggered by tamoxifen injection
Recombination occurs within days of treatment
Enables adult onset gene deletion after normal development
Allows study of acute versus chronic loss of function
(/tamoxifen-inducible-cre)
### Doxycycline Inducible (Tet Systems)
Tetracycline regulated systems use doxycycline to control Cre expression:
Tet On:** Cre expressed in presence of doxycycline
Tet Off:** Cre expressed in absence of doxycycline
Reversible control (unlike CreERT2 which causes permanent deletion)
Useful when reversible gene regulation is needed
(/tet-on-tet-off-systems)
### Combining Tissue and Temporal Control
Tissue specific CreERT2 lines combine spatial and temporal control. For example, Albumin CreERT2 enables tamoxifen inducible deletion specifically in hepatocytes, allowing study of gene function in adult liver without developmental effects.

### Derivative Allele System
Knockout First:** Original targeted allele with full stop cassette; gene disrupted by cassette insertion; LacZ reports expression (if included)
Conditional Ready:** Flp excision removes stop cassette; leaves LoxP flanked exon; gene function restored; this is the floxed allele
Conditional Null:** Cre excision removes critical exon; tissue specific or temporal knockout
This system allows a single project to support reporter studies, conventional knockout controls, and conditional knockout experiments.

## Applications
### Essential Genes
Many genes cause embryonic lethality when deleted globally. Conditional knockout bypasses developmental requirements by restricting gene deletion to specific tissues or to adult stages after development is complete.
### Pleiotropic Genes
Genes with functions in multiple organ systems produce complex phenotypes when deleted globally. Tissue specific conditional knockout isolates gene function in individual tissues, clarifying cell autonomous versus secondary effects.
### Cell Type Specific Questions
When research focuses on gene function in a specific cell type, conditional knockout provides direct answers without confounding effects from other tissues.
### Temporal Studies
Inducible Cre systems enable study of gene function at specific times: during development, in young adults, or in aged animals. This temporal control is valuable for modeling disease onset and studying acute versus chronic phenotypes.

## Frequently Asked Questions
What is the difference between LoxP and FRT sites?
LoxP sites are recognized by Cre recombinase; FRT sites are recognized by Flp recombinase. Both are 34 base pair sequences that enable DNA excision when two sites flank a DNA segment.
How do I choose between tissue-specific and inducible Cre systems?
Tissue-specific Cre provides spatial control (gene deleted in specific organs). Inducible Cre (CreERT2) provides temporal control (gene deleted at specific times). Combining both (tissue-specific CreERT2) provides maximum control. Choose based on whether you need spatial control, temporal control, or both.
What is a floxed allele?
A floxed allele has LoxP sites flanking a critical exon. The gene functions normally until exposed to Cre recombinase, which excises the DNA between LoxP sites and eliminates gene function. Floxed alleles are the foundation of conditional knockout strategies.
Can I use the same floxed mouse with different Cre drivers?
Yes. This is a major advantage of conditional systems. A single floxed allele can be crossed to any Cre driver line to achieve tissue-specific knockout in different organs. One floxed mouse project can support studies across multiple tissues and research programs.
