# Allergy Asthma Mouse Models
Since 1998, Ingenious Targeting Laboratory has supported allergy and asthma research with custom mouse models enabling mechanistic studies of airway inflammation, allergic responses, and therapeutic interventions. Our allergy and asthma models have contributed to research on Th2 immune responses, airway remodeling, and anti inflammatory therapeutics.
Allergy and asthma mouse models provide essential platforms for investigating the molecular pathways underlying allergic inflammation, testing hypotheses about immune cell contributions, and developing therapies for respiratory diseases affecting millions of patients worldwide.
## Allergy and Asthma Disease Mechanisms
### Th2 Immune Responses
Allergic asthma involves Th2 mediated inflammation:
IL4, IL5, IL13 production
Eosinophil recruitment
IgE production
Airway hyperresponsiveness
### Airway Remodeling
Chronic inflammation leads to:
Epithelial changes
Smooth muscle hypertrophy
Mucus production
Basement membrane thickening
## Model Types
### Induced Asthma Models
Models using allergen sensitization:
OVA (ovalbumin) sensitization
House dust mite models
Cockroach allergen models
Pollen allergen models
### Genetic Models
Gene targeted models for asthma research:
Th2 cytokine knockouts
Transcription factor models
Receptor modifications
Signaling pathway models
## Applications
### Therapeutic Testing
Evaluate anti inflammatory agents:
Corticosteroid efficacy
Biologic therapeutics
Small molecule inhibitors
Combination therapies
### Mechanism Studies
Investigate disease pathways:
Immune cell contributions
Cytokine networks
Airway remodeling mechanisms
Genetic susceptibility

## Frequently Asked Questions
What mouse models are used for asthma research?
Common asthma models include OVA-induced allergic airway inflammation, house dust mite models, and genetic models with conditional deletion of genes in lung epithelial cells, smooth muscle cells, or immune cells. Conditional knockout approaches enable tissue-specific study of asthma mechanisms without systemic effects.
Can you create models for specific asthma phenotypes?
Yes. ITL can design conditional knockout or knockin models targeting genes involved in airway hyperresponsiveness, mucus production, airway remodeling, or Th2 inflammation. Models can be combined with allergen challenge protocols to study specific asthma phenotypes.
What Cre drivers are appropriate for lung-specific studies?
Common lung Cre drivers include CC10-Cre (Clara cells), SPC-Cre (type II pneumocytes), alpha-SMA-Cre (smooth muscle), and Tie2-Cre (endothelial cells). Selection depends on whether you're studying airway epithelium, smooth muscle function, vascular remodeling, or immune cell recruitment.
How do you model allergic sensitization in mice?
Allergic sensitization is typically modeled through intranasal or intraperitoneal administration of allergens (OVA, house dust mite extract) with adjuvants, followed by repeated airway challenge. Genetic models can enhance susceptibility by modifying immune or epithelial barrier function.
