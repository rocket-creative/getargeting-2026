# C57BL/6 Mouse Background
Since 1998, Ingenious Targeting Laboratory has completed over 2,500 custom gene targeting projects, with the majority generated on C57BL/6 genetic backgrounds. Our experience across thousands of projects provides deep understanding of how strain background affects phenotypic outcomes, breeding performance, and experimental reproducibility.
The C57BL/6 mouse is the most widely used inbred strain for biomedical research and the reference strain for the mouse genome sequence. C57BL/6 backgrounds are preferred for most knockout, knockin, and conditional allele projects due to extensive phenotypic characterization, broad research community adoption, and compatibility with the majority of Cre driver lines.
Understanding the differences between C57BL/6 substrains is essential for experimental design. The two major substrains, C57BL/6J and C57BL/6N, diverged decades ago and carry distinct genetic variants that affect metabolism, behavior, and other phenotypes. Selecting the appropriate substrain ensures your model aligns with published literature and avoids confounding variables.
## C57BL/6 Substrain Differences
### C57BL/6J (Jackson Substrain)
C57BL/6J is the original Jackson Laboratory substrain and the reference for the mouse genome sequence. Key characteristics include:
Nnt mutation:** Spontaneous deletion in nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase affects mitochondrial redox balance and insulin secretion
Metabolic phenotype:** Impaired glucose stimulated insulin secretion; more susceptible to diet induced glucose intolerance
Behavioral phenotype:** Lower anxiety in some paradigms compared to C57BL/6N
Historical prevalence:** Most widely used substrain historically; extensive phenotypic literature
The Nnt mutation in C57BL/6J should be considered when studying metabolic phenotypes, particularly those involving pancreatic beta cell function or oxidative stress.
### C57BL/6N (NIH Substrain)
C57BL/6N originated from the NIH colony and is the substrain used by the International Knockout Mouse Consortium (IKMC). Key characteristics include:
Intact Nnt:** Functional nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase; normal mitochondrial function
Metabolic phenotype:** More robust glucose stimulated insulin secretion compared to C57BL/6J
Crb1 mutation:** Retinal degeneration allele (rd8) present in some C57BL/6N colonies; causes retinal lesions
IKMC compatibility:** ES cells and knockout alleles from EUCOMM/KOMP are on C57BL/6N background
C57BL/6N is often preferred for metabolic studies due to intact Nnt, but researchers should verify rd8 status when studying retinal or visual phenotypes.
### Choosing Between Substrains
Consider the Nnt status when studying metabolic phenotypes. Consider rd8 when studying retinal or visual phenotypes. For projects using IKMC alleles, C57BL/6N maintains pure background without backcrossing.

## Technical Considerations
### Backcrossing Requirements
When targeted alleles are generated on 129 strain backgrounds, backcrossing to C57BL/6 is required to achieve congenic status:
Speed congenic approaches using marker assisted selection can achieve N10 equivalent purity in fewer generations.
(/backcrossing-services)
### Breeding Performance
C57BL/6 mice have moderate breeding performance compared to outbred strains:
Average litter size: 5 to 7 pups
Weaning age: 21 days
First litter typically at 10 to 12 weeks of age
Good maternal behavior
Plan breeding timelines accounting for these parameters when estimating cohort development schedules.
### Health and Husbandry
C57BL/6 mice are generally robust with good health profiles:
Compatible with SPF housing conditions
Moderate lifespan (approximately 24 to 30 months)
Low incidence of spontaneous tumors at typical experimental ages
Susceptible to age related hearing loss (Ahl locus)

## Frequently Asked Questions
What is the difference between C57BL/6J and C57BL/6N?
C57BL/6J has a mutation in the Nnt (nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase) gene that affects insulin secretion and diabetes susceptibility. C57BL/6N has intact Nnt and different metabolic characteristics. For metabolic studies, choose 6J if you want diabetes susceptibility or 6N if you want intact insulin secretion. For most other applications, either substrain works well.
Why is C57BL/6 the most commonly used strain background?
C57BL/6 is well-characterized genetically, has extensive baseline phenotypic data, is compatible with most Cre driver lines, and has good breeding performance. The strain is suitable for immunological, metabolic, neurological, and oncology research, making it the standard choice for most studies.
Do I need to backcross if I use C57BL/6 ES cells?
No. Using C57BL/6N ES cells eliminates backcrossing requirements and provides pure inbred background directly from germline transmission. Models generated on 129 strains require backcrossing to C57BL/6 to achieve congenic status (10 generations or 5-7 with speed congenic).
What Cre driver lines are available on C57BL/6?
Most common Cre driver lines are available on C57BL/6, including tissue-specific drivers (Albumin-Cre, Nestin-Cre, LysM-Cre, CD4-Cre, etc.) and inducible systems (CreERT2). This extensive Cre driver availability is a major advantage of choosing C57BL/6 background.
Can I switch my model to a different strain background later?
Yes, but it requires systematic backcrossing. Traditional backcrossing requires 10 generations (approximately 2.5 years) to achieve >99.9% background purity. Speed congenic approaches using marker-assisted selection can reduce this to 5-7 generations (approximately 1-1.5 years). It's best to select the appropriate background from the start.
## Strain Background Selection Considerations
### Research Application Alignment
When selecting a C57BL/6 substrain, consider how your research application aligns with published literature. If your field predominantly uses C57BL/6J models, maintaining consistency with existing literature may outweigh substrain specific advantages. Conversely, if metabolic phenotypes are central to your research, C57BL/6N may provide advantages.
For metabolic disease research, the functional Nnt gene in C57BL/6N can provide more physiologically relevant insulin secretion responses. For behavioral studies, substrain differences in anxiety and exploratory behavior should be considered when interpreting results.
### Breeding Performance
Both C57BL/6J and C57BL/6N demonstrate excellent breeding performance, though individual lines may show variation. When generating conditional alleles requiring extensive breeding with Cre driver lines, substrain compatibility should be verified. Most commonly used Cre driver lines are maintained on C57BL/6J backgrounds.
Ingenious Targeting Laboratory can provide guidance on substrain selection based on your specific research requirements and breeding plans.
