# Transgenic Mouse Models
Since 1998, Ingenious Targeting Laboratory has completed over 2,500 custom gene targeting projects for researchers at universities, pharmaceutical companies, and research institutions worldwide. Our mouse models have supported research published in more than 800 peer reviewed articles including in Science, Nature, and Cell.
Transgenic mouse models introduce exogenous DNA sequences into the mouse genome for overexpression studies, tissue specific Cre driver generation, reporter line creation, and other applications requiring expression of non native sequences. Unlike knockin models that modify endogenous loci, transgenic approaches add new genetic elements either through random integration or targeted insertion at safe harbor loci.
ITL offers targeted transgenic approaches using ROSA26 and other safe harbor loci, providing options matched to your experimental requirements.
## Transgenic Approaches
### Conventional Transgenesis
Conventional transgenic mice are generated by pronuclear injection of DNA constructs into fertilized oocytes. The transgene integrates randomly into the genome, typically as a multi copy array. This approach is rapid and cost effective for applications where precise copy number and integration site are not critical.
Conventional transgenesis is commonly used for overexpression studies, generation of multiple founder lines for comparison, and applications where high expression levels are desired.
### BAC Transgenesis
BAC (bacterial artificial chromosome) transgenic mice carry large genomic fragments up to 200 kb, including the gene of interest with its native regulatory elements. BAC transgenics often show more physiological expression patterns than conventional transgenics because distant enhancers and regulatory regions are preserved.
BAC transgenesis is particularly valuable for generating Cre driver lines where accurate tissue specific expression is essential.
### ROSA26 Targeted Transgenics
ROSA26 targeted transgenics insert transgene constructs at the ROSA26 safe harbor locus. This approach provides single copy integration at a defined genomic location with predictable expression characteristics.
ROSA26 targeting eliminates the positional effects common with random integration and ensures consistent expression across breeding generations.

### Other Safe Harbor Loci
In addition to ROSA26, transgenes can be targeted to other safe harbor loci including HPRT and H11. Each locus offers distinct expression characteristics and can be selected based on desired expression levels and tissue distribution.
## Applications
### Cre Driver Lines
Transgenic Cre driver lines express Cre recombinase under tissue specific promoters, enabling conditional gene manipulation when crossed to floxed alleles. At ingenious, Cre drivers can be targeted to the ROSA26 locus or to an endogenous gene of interest.

### Reporter Lines
Transgenic reporter lines express visualization markers under constitutive or tissue specific promoters. Common reporters include fluorescent proteins for live imaging, luciferase for bioluminescence studies, and LacZ for histological analysis.
ROSA26 targeted reporters provide consistent expression and can be designed as Cre dependent systems for lineage tracing applications.
### Inducible Expression Systems
Transgenic mice carrying inducible expression systems allow controlled activation of transgene expression. Common systems include:
Tet On / Tet Off:** Doxycycline regulated expression
CreERT2:** Tamoxifen inducible Cre expression
Cre dependent:** Expression activated by Cre mediated removal of stop cassette
Inducible transgenics enable temporal control over gene expression for studying acute effects and adult onset phenotypes.

## Frequently Asked Questions
What is the difference between transgenic and knockin models?
Transgenic models introduce exogenous DNA sequences through random integration (pronuclear injection) or targeted insertion at safe-harbor loci (ROSA26). Knockin models modify endogenous gene loci through homologous recombination. Transgenics add new genetic elements; knockins modify existing genes at their native locations.
When should I use conventional transgenesis vs ROSA26 targeting?
Use conventional transgenesis for rapid generation, multiple founder lines for comparison, or when high expression levels are desired. Use ROSA26 targeting for single-copy integration at a defined location, predictable expression patterns, or when position effects must be avoided. ROSA26 provides more consistent expression across generations.
What is BAC transgenesis and when is it used?
BAC (bacterial artificial chromosome) transgenesis uses large genomic fragments (100-200 kb) including the gene of interest with native regulatory elements. BAC transgenics show more physiological expression patterns than conventional transgenics because distant enhancers and regulatory regions are preserved. BAC transgenesis is particularly valuable for generating Cre driver lines.
Can transgenic models be used for conditional expression?
Yes. Transgenic models can incorporate conditional expression cassettes including loxP-stop-loxP for Cre-dependent expression, TRE-driven systems for doxycycline control, or other inducible systems. ROSA26-targeted transgenics are commonly used for conditional reporter or Cre expression.
