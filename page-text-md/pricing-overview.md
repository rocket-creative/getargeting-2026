# Mouse Model Pricing Overview
Custom mouse model pricing depends on project complexity, model type, and scope of services. Ingenious Targeting Laboratory provides customized quotes based on your specific research requirements. This overview explains the factors that influence project pricing and helps you understand what to expect.
## Pricing Factors
### Model Type
Different model types involve varying levels of complexity:
Conventional Knockout projects involve deletion or disruption of a target gene. These represent the most straightforward targeting projects.
Conditional Knockout projects require insertion of loxP sites flanking critical exons while preserving normal gene function. Additional design complexity increases project investment.
Knockin projects range widely in complexity:
Point mutations represent relatively simple modifications
cDNA knockins require precise sequence insertion
Large insertions (reporters, human sequences) add complexity
Multi component knockins require extensive design
Humanized Models involve replacing mouse sequences with human counterparts. Complexity depends on sequence size and design requirements.
### Allele Design Complexity
Factors that increase allele complexity:
Multiple recombinase recognition sites (loxP, FRT, Rox)
Reporter gene insertions
Fusion protein designs
Large sequence insertions
Inducible elements
Dual recombinase compatibility
### Strain Background
Standard strain options include C57BL/6, BALB/c, and 129 strain ES cells.
### Project Scope
Complete Projects include targeting vector through germline transmission.
Partial Services such as vector only, ES cell targeting only, or microinjection only are priced according to scope.
Post Project Services including cohort expansion, colony management, and cryopreservation are quoted separately.
## What Is Included
### Standard Complete Project Includes
Targeting Vector
Custom vector design optimized for your target
Vector construction and quality control
Sequence verified plasmid
Vector map and documentation
ES Cell Targeting
ES cell electroporation
Drug selection
Clone picking and expansion
Southern blot screening
PCR confirmation
Sequence verification of targeted clones
Characterized ES cell stocks (frozen)
Mouse Generation
Blastocyst microinjection
Chimera generation and identification
Germline transmission breeding

Archived ES cell clones
### Not Typically Included
These services are quoted separately based on need:
Cohort expansion beyond founders
Colony management and breeding
Cryopreservation services
Rederivation

Phenotyping and characterization
## Payment Structure
Projects are typically billed in milestone payments aligned with project phases:
Milestone 1: Project initiation (targeting vector construction)
Milestone 2: ES cell targeting complete (clone characterization)
Milestone 3: Microinjection complete (chimera generation)
Milestone 4: Project completion (germline transmission)
Specific payment schedules are included in your project proposal.

### Quote Delivery
Within 1 business day, you will receive:
Recommended targeting strategy
Allele design overview
Project timeline by phase
Itemized pricing
Terms and conditions
### Quote Validity
Quotes are typically valid for 90 days. Timeline estimates may be updated if significant time passes before project initiation.
## Budget Planning
### Cost Saving Strategies
Derivative Allele Approach: Generate multiple model types from a single targeting event, maximizing research value per project investment.
Partial Services: If you have in house capabilities for some project phases, partial service options reduce overall cost.
Colony Planning: Consider founder number and breeding timeline to balance initial investment with downstream needs.
## Catalog Models
For certain applications, Ingenious Targeting Laboratory offers catalog models at fixed pricing:
Humanized Immune Checkpoint Mice
PD1 humanized
PDL1 humanized
CTLA4 humanized
LAG3 humanized
TIM3 humanized
Single and double checkpoint combinations
Catalog models provide defined genetics at predictable pricing with shorter lead times than custom projects.

What about grant budget constraints?
Our team can help design projects that align with funding parameters while maximizing research value.
Can pricing be adjusted mid project?
Scope changes during a project may affect pricing. Any adjustments are discussed and approved before implementation.
What is the cancellation policy?
Cancellation terms are included in project agreements. Costs incurred through the date of cancellation typically apply.

## Frequently Asked Questions
What factors affect mouse model pricing?
Pricing depends on model type (conventional knockout, conditional knockout, knockin, humanized, transgenic), allele design complexity (multiple recombinase sites, reporters, large insertions), strain background (standard vs specialty strains), project scope (complete project vs partial services), and timeline requirements (standard vs rush).
What is included in standard project pricing?
Standard complete projects include targeting vector design and construction, ES cell targeting and clone characterization, chimera generation, germline transmission verification, genotyping protocols, and documentation. Pre-germline characterization validates allele structure before mouse generation. Additional services (cohort expansion, cryopreservation) are quoted separately.
Can I get pricing for partial services?
Yes. ITL provides pricing for partial services including targeting vector only, ES cell targeting only, microinjection only, or other partial services. Partial service pricing is based on the specific scope of work. Contact ITL to discuss your partial service needs and receive a customized quote.
