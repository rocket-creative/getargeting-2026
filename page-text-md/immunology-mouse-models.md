# Immunology Mouse Models
Since 1998, Ingenious Targeting Laboratory has supported immunology researchers with custom mouse models contributing to peer reviewed publications in Immunity, Nature Immunology, Journal of Experimental Medicine, and leading immunology journals worldwide. Our immunology mouse models have advanced understanding of immune cell development, autoimmune pathogenesis, and inflammatory disease mechanisms.
Immunology mouse models enable researchers to investigate immune cell development, activation, and effector function, as well as the dysregulation underlying autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. From T cell and B cell specific knockouts that dissect lymphocyte biology to humanized immune checkpoint models for therapeutic testing, the right model design is critical for immunological discovery and translational success.
Conditional approaches are essential in immunology research, where the same gene often has distinct functions in different immune cell populations. A gene required for T cell development may have entirely different roles in B cells, macrophages, or dendritic cells. Cell type specific conditional knockouts enable precise dissection of these lineage specific functions.
## Research Applications in Immunology
### Understanding Immune Function
Genetically engineered mouse models have transformed our understanding of immune system development and function. Knockout models reveal essential gene functions in lymphocyte development, antigen recognition, and effector responses. Reporter knockins enable visualization of immune cell populations and tracking of lineage relationships during immune responses.
Conditional approaches allow gene manipulation in specific immune cell types at defined developmental stages, enabling dissection of gene function without disrupting earlier developmental requirements.
### Modeling Immune Dysregulation
Mouse models of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases have been essential for understanding disease mechanisms and testing therapeutic approaches. Key modeling strategies include:
Immune gene knockouts:** Study loss of tolerance and autoimmune pathogenesis
Knockin of disease variants:** Express human autoimmune susceptibility alleles
Humanization:** Replace mouse immune genes with human orthologs for therapeutic testing
Reporter models:** Track autoreactive cell populations during disease progression
### Therapeutic Development
Immunology mouse models support therapeutic development across autoimmune disease, transplantation, and immuno oncology. Humanized immune checkpoint models enable direct testing of clinical antibody candidates, while cell type specific knockouts model target inhibition in relevant immune populations.
## Autoimmune Disease Models
### Systemic Autoimmune Disease
Models of systemic autoimmunity address diseases such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis where multiple organ systems are affected:
Lupus models:** Knockout and knockin models affecting B cell tolerance and autoantibody production
Rheumatoid arthritis models:** Conditional knockouts in synovial and immune compartments
Sjogren syndrome models:** Models of exocrine gland autoimmunity
(/lupus-mouse-models)
(/rheumatoid-arthritis-mice)
### Organ Specific Autoimmunity
Organ specific autoimmune models focus on immune attack against particular tissues:
Multiple sclerosis models:** CNS specific autoimmunity and demyelination
Type 1 diabetes models:** Beta cell autoimmune destruction
Autoimmune thyroiditis:** Thyroid specific inflammation
Myasthenia gravis models:** Neuromuscular junction autoimmunity
Conditional knockouts enable study of gene function specifically in the target organ or in the autoreactive immune population.
## Inflammatory Disease Models
### Inflammatory Bowel Disease
IBD models address chronic intestinal inflammation characteristic of Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis:
Epithelial knockouts:** Study barrier function and epithelial immune responses
T cell specific knockouts:** Investigate pathogenic T cell populations
Macrophage knockouts:** Analyze innate immune contributions to colitis
Combination models:** Genetic susceptibility combined with microbial triggers
(/ibd-mouse-models)
### Allergy and Asthma Models
Allergic disease models address IgE mediated hypersensitivity and airway inflammation:
Mast cell knockouts:** Study immediate hypersensitivity
Th2 pathway modifications:** Investigate allergic inflammation
Epithelial barrier models:** Analyze sensitization and tolerance
Eosinophil modifications:** Study effector cell function in allergy

## Humanized Immune Models

Humanized checkpoint models express human versions of immune regulatory proteins for therapeutic antibody testing:
Single and dual checkpoint humanized models support evaluation of monotherapy and combination immunotherapy approaches.

### Cytokine and Receptor Humanization
Humanization of cytokines, cytokine receptors, and other immune molecules enables testing of human specific therapeutics in an immunocompetent mouse system.

## Technical Considerations
### Pre Germline Characterization
ES cell based targeting enables comprehensive characterization of immunology alleles before mouse generation. This pre germline analysis confirms correct allele structure, mutation sequence, and absence of random integration events.
For humanized immune models, sequence verification confirms exact human sequence integration. Functional testing can verify human specific antibody binding in ES cells prior to mouse production.
### Strain Background Considerations
Strain background significantly impacts immune phenotypes. Key considerations include:
C57BL/6:** Th1 biased, commonly used for autoimmune models
BALB/c:** Th2 biased, preferred for some allergy and parasitic disease studies
NOD:** Spontaneous autoimmune diabetes, useful background for type 1 diabetes models
129 strains:** Variable immune phenotypes depending on substrain
MHC haplotype differences between strains affect antigen presentation and T cell responses. Our scientific team advises on optimal strain selection for immunological phenotyping.

### Derivative Allele Flexibility
The derivative allele system provides maximum flexibility for immunology research programs:
tm1a:** Reporter allele for immune cell expression analysis
tm1b:** Null allele for global knockout studies
tm1c:** Conditional allele for cell type specific deletion
tm1d:** Conditional null after Cre mediated excision
A single project generates alleles suitable for global knockout studies, cell type specific conditional knockouts across multiple immune lineages, and reporter analysis of gene expression patterns.

## Frequently Asked Questions
What types of immune cell-specific knockouts can be generated?
Common immune cell-specific Cre drivers include CD4-Cre (T cells), CD19-Cre (B cells), LysM-Cre (myeloid cells/macrophages), and CX3CR1-Cre (microglia). Inducible Cre systems enable temporal control. Cell type selection depends on your research question and target gene function.
Why are humanized immune checkpoint models needed for immunotherapy research?
Most checkpoint inhibitor antibodies are designed to target human proteins and do not cross-react with mouse orthologs. Humanized checkpoint models express human PD1, PDL1, CTLA4, or other targets, enabling efficacy testing of clinical antibodies in immunocompetent mice with functional immune systems.
What strain background should I use for immunology studies?
C57BL/6 is most common for autoimmune and Th1-biased immune responses. BALB/c is preferred for Th2-biased responses and some allergy studies. NOD background is used for type 1 diabetes models. Strain selection affects immune phenotype, so choose based on your experimental requirements.
Can I combine multiple immune gene modifications in one model?
Yes. Multiple alleles can be combined through breeding to study gene interactions in immune pathways. For example, combining T cell and B cell knockouts enables study of how adaptive immune components interact. Humanized checkpoint combinations (e.g., PD1/CTLA4) support combination immunotherapy studies.
How do conditional knockouts work for immune cell-specific studies?
Floxed alleles are crossed to cell type-specific Cre drivers. For example, a floxed gene crossed to CD4-Cre produces T cell-specific knockout while preserving gene function in other cell types. This enables study of cell-autonomous versus non-cell-autonomous immune gene function.
