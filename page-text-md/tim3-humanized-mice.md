# TIM3 Humanized Mouse Models
Since 1998, ingenious targeting laboratory has supported immuno oncology research with humanized immune checkpoint models including TIM3 humanized mice that enable direct preclinical evaluation of clinical anti TIM3 antibody candidates and next generation combination checkpoint blockade strategies.
TIM3 humanized mice express human TIM3 (HAVCR2) protein on T cells and other immune populations, enabling testing of human specific therapeutic antibodies in immunocompetent animals with intact tumor immunity. These models are essential for evaluating the emerging class of anti TIM3 therapeutics in development.
## TIM3 in Cancer Immunotherapy
T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain containing 3 (TIM3, also known as HAVCR2) is an immune checkpoint receptor under active clinical development, with multiple anti TIM3 antibodies in trials for various malignancies.
### TIM3 Biology
TIM3 is expressed on multiple immune cell populations and contributes to immune regulation:
T Cell Expression
TIM3 is upregulated on activated and exhausted T cells. Co expression of TIM3 with PD1 marks the most dysfunctional T cell population in chronic infection and cancer.
Innate Immune Cell Expression
TIM3 is constitutively expressed on macrophages, dendritic cells, and mast cells, regulating their inflammatory responses.
NK Cell Expression
TIM3 is expressed on natural killer cells and can inhibit their cytotoxic function.
### TIM3 Ligands
TIM3 has multiple ligands affecting its function:
Galectin 9
Carbohydrate binding protein that triggers TIM3 mediated T cell death.
Phosphatidylserine
TIM3 binds phosphatidylserine on apoptotic cells, contributing to clearance.
CEACAM1
Carcinoembryonic antigen related cell adhesion molecule 1 binds TIM3 and promotes T cell exhaustion.
HMGB1
High mobility group box 1 binding to TIM3 on dendritic cells interferes with nucleic acid sensing.
### Clinical Anti TIM3 Antibodies
Multiple anti TIM3 antibodies are in clinical development:
Cobolimab (TSR 022)
Anti TIM3 antibody in combination trials with anti PD1.
Sabatolimab (MBG453)
Anti TIM3 antibody being evaluated in hematologic malignancies and solid tumors.
Additional Candidates
Multiple other anti TIM3 antibodies are in early clinical development.
### Species Specificity
Clinical anti TIM3 antibodies are designed for human TIM3 and typically do not cross react with mouse Tim3, necessitating humanized models for preclinical evaluation.
## TIM3 Humanization Strategies
### Complete Gene Replacement
Full replacement of mouse Havcr2 with human HAVCR2 (TIM3) coding sequences:
Endogenous Regulatory Control
Human TIM3 expressed from the native mouse promoter maintains physiological expression patterns.
Functional Preservation
The humanized allele preserves TIM3 function on T cells, NK cells, and myeloid populations.
Extracellular Domain Humanization
Humanization of the extracellular domain provides human epitopes for antibody binding.
### Design Considerations
Expression on Multiple Cell Types
TIM3 is expressed on T cells, NK cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages. Humanization should preserve expression across these populations.
Ligand Binding
Consider whether human TIM3 appropriately binds mouse galectin 9 and other ligands.
Signaling Compatibility
Mouse intracellular domains may be retained for compatibility with mouse signaling machinery.
## Applications of TIM3 Humanized Mice
### Monotherapy Evaluation
Testing anti TIM3 antibodies as single agents:
Syngeneic Tumor Models
TIM3 humanized mice combined with syngeneic tumors enable efficacy assessment.
Dose Response
Establish pharmacologically relevant dosing for clinical candidates.
Target Engagement
Measure antibody binding to TIM3 positive cells in tumor and lymphoid tissues.
### Combination Checkpoint Blockade
TIM3 is primarily developed in combination:
TIM3 plus PD1
The most common combination under investigation. Dual humanized models expressing both human TIM3 and human PD1 enable testing.
TIM3 plus LAG3
Alternative checkpoint combinations.
Triple Combinations
TIM3 plus PD1 plus CTLA4 or other three way combinations.

### T Cell Exhaustion Studies
TIM3 is a key marker of T cell exhaustion:
Exhaustion Reversal
Assess whether TIM3 blockade reinvigorates exhausted T cells.
Combination Effects
Evaluate synergy with PD1 blockade in reversing exhaustion.
Phenotypic Analysis
Characterize changes in exhaustion markers following TIM3 blockade.
### Innate Immune Effects
TIM3 on myeloid cells affects anti tumor immunity:
Dendritic Cell Activation
TIM3 blockade may enhance dendritic cell function and antigen presentation.
Macrophage Polarization
Effects on tumor associated macrophage phenotype.
## Multi Checkpoint Humanized Models
Combination checkpoint approaches require models expressing multiple human targets:
### Dual Humanized Models
TIM3 plus PD1
Both checkpoints humanized for testing emerging combinations.
TIM3 plus LAG3
For alternative combination studies.
### Higher Order Combinations
TIM3 plus PD1 plus LAG3
Triple humanization for comprehensive checkpoint blockade studies.
TIM3 plus PD1 plus CTLA4
Alternative triple combination.
### Breeding Considerations
Multi humanized models require complex breeding:
Chromosomal Location
Consider linkage when planning crosses.
Allele Validation
Confirm each humanized allele functions correctly in the combined genotype.
## Model Design Considerations
### Background Strain Selection
C57BL/6
Standard background for immuno oncology studies. Compatible with commonly used syngeneic tumor models.
BALB/c
Alternative for specific tumor models.

“I’ve been working with iTL over the past 5 years in the production of 3 different genetically altered mice. Not only did iTL help in the design of the mice, but the entire process was transparent with the opportunity at any time along the way to discuss my questions or concerns with scientists who had significant insight into the process. The mice were delivered on time, as billed!”

## Frequently Asked Questions
What is the difference between full humanization and ECD-only humanization for TIM3?
Full humanization replaces the entire mouse TIM3 (Havcr2) gene with human TIM3 (HAVCR2) sequence. ECD-only humanization replaces only the extracellular domain while retaining mouse transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. Full humanization is preferred for antibody testing; ECD-only may preserve some mouse signaling functions.
Can TIM3 humanized mice be combined with other checkpoint humanizations?
Yes. TIM3 humanization can be combined with PD1, PDL1, CTLA4, LAG3, or other checkpoint humanizations to create double, triple, or multi-checkpoint models. Common combinations include TIM3+PD1 and TIM3+LAG3 for combination checkpoint blockade studies targeting exhausted T cells.
Can TIM3 humanized mice be used with syngeneic tumor models?
Yes. TIM3 humanized mice can be combined with syngeneic tumor cell lines (MC38, B16, LLC) to create systems where both tumor and immune compartments express human targets. This enables evaluation of checkpoint blockade in immunocompetent animals with intact tumor immunity, providing more physiologically relevant testing.
