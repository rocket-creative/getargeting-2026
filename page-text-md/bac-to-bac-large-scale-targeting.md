# BAC Targeting
Since 1998, ingenious targeting laboratory has completed over 2,500 gene targeting projects, including those using BAC recombineering, to preserve extensive regulatory elements and large genomic fragments exceeding 100 kilobases. This specialized approach enables researchers to study gene regulation in physiologically relevant contexts impossible to replicate with smaller insert designs.
BAC targeting converts large genomic fragments into functional targeting vectors while maintaining complete regulatory architecture spanning 5 prime promoters, enhancer elements, coding sequences, and 3 prime regulatory regions. This methodology has become increasingly valuable as research emphasis shifts toward understanding complex gene regulation rather than simplified knockout or knockin modifications.
## BAC Recombineering Fundamentals
BAC recombineering utilizes homologous recombination between short homologous sequences (typically 50 base pairs minimum) in E. coli strains expressing bacteriophage lambda recombination genes and Cre recombinase. This approach permits rapid modification of large BAC clones to insert targeting vector sequences, remove irrelevant genomic regions, or add functional cassettes without extensive restriction enzyme digestion or ligation.
Original BAC clones derived from genomic libraries contain ~140 kilobase inserts with flanking vector sequences. Recombineering allows researchers to modify these clones by inserting targeting vector sequences including homologous recombination arms, selection cassettes, and functional elements while preserving the complete desired genomic insert. The process operates with minimal limitations on insert size or complexity compared to conventional restriction enzyme based cloning.
### BAC Source Selection and Characterization
Research teams typically identify appropriate BAC clones from existing genomic libraries covering mouse, human, rat, or other organism genomes. Clone selection requires careful attention to insert structure to ensure BAC spans the complete genomic region of interest including all relevant regulatory elements. Public databases (NCBI, Ensembl, UCSC) facilitate clone identification, though researchers must verify clone adequacy for specific applications.
Physical characterization of BAC inserts using restriction mapping and gel electrophoresis confirms clone structure before initiating targeting vector construction. This pre characterization minimizes clones with unexpected deletions, rearrangements, or unsuitable insert boundaries.
### Recombineering Cassette Insertion
Standard BAC recombineering procedures insert selection cassettes and homologous recombination arm sequences into BAC clones using FRT flanked cassettes for subsequent removal.
## Large Genomic Fragment Preservation
BAC targeting excels for applications requiring preservation of complete regulatory elements controlling endogenous gene expression. Research investigating how 5 prime regulatory regions drive cell type specific or developmental stage specific expression benefits substantially from BAC insert capacity preserving complete promoter architecture spanning multiple kilobases.
Studies examining long range regulatory elements including silencers and locus control regions spatially separated from coding sequences require BAC scale insert capacity to maintain these regulatory relationships in transgenic context. Smaller insert designs frequently truncate regulatory elements or disrupt long range interactions, yielding transgenic expression patterns diverging substantially from endogenous regulation.
### Copy Number and Integration Site Considerations
BAC inserts at safe harbor loci (H11, ROSA26, HPRT) typically integrate as single copy events when ES cell characterization confirms appropriate clones. Researchers should anticipate the possibility of multi copy or partial rearrangement events and screen founder lines for expected phenotype when direct genotypic characterization is not performed.
Ectopic integration outside intended safe harbor locus occasionally occurs during ES cell targeting, introducing unexplained variability into transgenic lines. Junction PCR across integration sites coupled with whole genome sequencing can identify unexpected integrations.
### Internal Rearrangement Risk Assessment
Large genomic fragments carry inherent risk of internal rearrangement during bacterial propagation, recombineering procedures, or ES cell targeting. BAC DNA inherent genetic instability in some E. coli strains can introduce deletions or rearrangements unpredictable in nature and extent. Careful strain selection using recombineering proficient strains with minimal rearrangement rates minimizes risk.
Researchers should verify BAC insert structure before recombineering through restriction mapping and gel electrophoresis, and again after recombineering modifications to confirm stability.
## ES Cell Targeting of Large Recombineered BACs
Targeting vector construction using recombineered BACs creates very large targeting constructs (often 200+ kilobases) requiring special electroporation and ES cell selection protocols. Standard ES cell electroporation equipment accommodates these large DNA molecules, though transfection efficiency may be reduced compared to standard vectors.
### Pre Germline Characterization Importance
Pre germline ES cell analysis becomes particularly critical for large insert targeting to detect internal rearrangement events originating during vector construction or ES cell targeting.
Copy number verification through PCR or qPCR confirms single copy integration rather than unexpected multi copy events or partial integrations. Researchers should not proceed with mouse generation until ES cell characterization confirms clone adequacy, preventing months wasted on invalid genetic material.
### Junction Characterization
PCR and sequencing across insertion junctions between endogenous genome and transgene sequences confirms correct targeting at intended locus. Junction characterization using genome specific primers and transgene specific primers permits generation of sequence data proving insertion occurred as intended rather than probabilistic inference.
## Timeline and Project Planning for BAC Targeting
BAC targeting projects typically require 8-12 months from project initiation through germline confirmation. Timeline variability reflects BAC complexity, recombineering round requirements, and ES cell characterization thoroughness.
Phase 1: BAC Selection and Characterization
Genomic library searches identify candidate BAC clones. Physical characterization via restriction mapping and gel electrophoresis confirms insert structure and boundaries. Multiple BAC clones may require testing to identify optimal clones for specific applications.
Phase 2: Recombineering Vector Construction
Targeting vector sequences and functional cassettes insert into BAC clones via sequential recombineering rounds. Each round requires bacterial growth, selection, and characterization, with multiple rounds often necessary for complex modifications.
Phase 3: ES Cell Targeting and Selection
Targeting vectors transfect into ES cells, undergo selection, and yield correctly targeted clones at frequencies 10 to 100 fold lower than standard vectors. Clonal isolation and extended characterization is required, as well as junction sequencing.
Phase 4: Chimera Generation
Correctly targeted ES cell clones contribute to chimeric mice via blastocyst injection. Germline transmission verification through breeding of male chimeras and genotyping of offspring establishes stable transgenic lines.
## Applications Ideally Suited to BAC Targeting
Disease modeling with large human genomic inserts spanning complete disease associated loci benefits substantially from BAC targeting capacity. Researchers can insert disease associated human loci (100+ kilobases including regulatory elements) into mouse genomes while maintaining human genetic context relevant to disease mechanisms.
Regulatory element studies examining how multiple enhancers and silencers coordinate gene expression require BAC insert capacity to preserve these relationships in transgenic contexts. Studies of tissue specific and developmental stage specific expression driven by complex promoter architecture depend on BAC scale inserts preserving complete regulatory information.
Complex transgenic studies combining multiple functional elements (promoters, genes, reporters, regulatory cassettes) in defined spatial arrangements benefit from BAC recombineering flexibility permitting precise cassette assembly. Researchers can construct sophisticated genetic configurations otherwise impossible within practical vector size limitations.

## What Researchers Say
“The project was very well managed…in fact, using iTL validated my decision to not try and do this in my own lab. It would have been a catastrophe… (My project manager) was very helpful, always getting back to us in time and explaining every step of the project. I would be glad to serve as a reference for iTL and its staff.”

## Frequently Asked Questions
What is the maximum insert size for BAC targeting?
BAC inserts typically span 100 to 180 kilobases with practical capacity for full genomic features. Inserts exceeding 200 kilobases face declining insertion efficiency and increasing structural instability. Custom vector engineering may accommodate larger inserts for specific applications, though standard BAC protocols optimize for 100 to 150 kilobase inserts.
How does internal rearrangement risk affect BAC targeting?
BAC DNA inherent instability in certain E. coli strains introduces deletions and rearrangements unpredictable in extent and location. Pre-targeting and post-targeting characterization through gel electrophoresis and restriction mapping detects gross alterations, though some internal changes may escape detection. Careful strain selection and handling minimize but cannot eliminate rearrangement risk.
Can BAC inserts contain known disease mutations?
Yes, researchers frequently construct disease model BAC inserts containing specific point mutations, deletions, or other variants identified in human disease. BAC recombineering permits introduction of precise sequence changes within large genomic context, enabling investigation of disease mechanisms within realistic regulatory environment.
What characterization confirms successful BAC integration?
PCR or qPCR confirms single copy integration. Junction PCR across integration boundaries provides sequence evidence of correct targeting.
