# NASH Mouse Models
Since 1998, ingenious targeting laboratory has supported metabolic liver disease research with custom mouse models enabling mechanistic studies of hepatic steatosis, steatohepatitis, and fibrosis progression underlying the global epidemic of metabolic dysfunction associated fatty liver disease.
NASH MASH mouse models provide essential platforms for investigating the molecular pathways driving progression from simple steatosis to steatohepatitis and cirrhosis, testing hypotheses about lipotoxicity and inflammation, and developing therapies for this increasingly prevalent condition.
## Understanding NASH and MASH
The terminology for fatty liver disease has evolved to better reflect its metabolic etiology:
### Current Nomenclature
MAFLD (Metabolic Associated Fatty Liver Disease)
Broader term encompassing hepatic steatosis associated with metabolic dysfunction, regardless of alcohol consumption.
MASLD (Metabolic Dysfunction Associated Steatotic Liver Disease)
Current preferred terminology for non alcoholic fatty liver disease.
MASH (Metabolic Dysfunction Associated Steatohepatitis)
The progressive form with inflammation and hepatocyte injury, previously termed NASH (non alcoholic steatohepatitis).
### Disease Progression
The disease exists on a spectrum:
Simple Steatosis
Hepatic fat accumulation (>5% of hepatocytes) without significant inflammation. Often reversible with lifestyle intervention.
Steatohepatitis (MASH)
Steatosis plus lobular inflammation, hepatocyte ballooning, and injury. Risk of progression to fibrosis.
Fibrosis
Collagen deposition and architectural distortion. Staged F0 to F4.
Cirrhosis
Advanced fibrosis with nodule formation. Risk of hepatocellular carcinoma and liver failure.
## Dietary Models
### High Fat Diet Models
Standard High Fat Diet (HFD)
45% to 60% fat calories produces obesity and hepatic steatosis in C57BL/6 mice over 12 to 24 weeks. Produces mild steatohepatitis but minimal fibrosis.
Western Diet
High fat plus high fructose/sucrose mimics Western dietary patterns. More severe metabolic phenotype than HFD alone.
Fast Food Diet
High fat, high cholesterol, high fructose combination produces more severe disease with fibrosis.
### Specialized Dietary Models
Choline Deficient High Fat Diet (CDHFD)
Choline deficiency accelerates steatohepatitis and fibrosis development. Widely used for rapid disease induction.
Methionine Choline Deficient Diet (MCD)
Produces severe steatohepatitis and fibrosis but with weight loss rather than obesity. Does not model metabolic syndrome.
AMLN Diet (Amylin Liver NASH)
High trans fat, high fructose, high cholesterol diet produces obesity, steatohepatitis, and fibrosis with metabolic syndrome features.
DIAMOND Model
Isogenic C57BL/6J 129S1/SvImJ hybrid on Western diet develops full disease spectrum including hepatocellular carcinoma.
## Genetic Models
### Lipid Metabolism Genes
PNPLA3 I148M Knockin
The most common genetic risk variant for fatty liver disease in humans. Knockin mice with the human I148M variant develop more severe steatosis and fibrosis on lipogenic diets.
TM6SF2 E167K Knockin
Second most common variant. Affects VLDL secretion and hepatic lipid accumulation.
HSD17B13 Loss of Function
Protective variant in humans. HSD17B13 knockout mice show altered lipid metabolism.
MBOAT7 Variants
Membrane bound O acyltransferase 7 variants affect phospholipid remodeling.
### Insulin Signaling and Metabolism
Liver Specific Insulin Receptor Knockout (LIRKO)
Hepatocyte insulin resistance model. Develops steatosis and glucose intolerance.
PTEN Liver Knockout
Severe steatohepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma development.
FXR Knockout
Farnesoid X receptor deficiency affects bile acid and lipid metabolism.
### Inflammatory Pathway Models
NLRP3 Inflammasome
Inflammasome activation drives steatohepatitis. NLRP3 knockout or knockin models for pathway analysis.
ASK1 Pathway
Apoptosis signal regulating kinase 1 mediates lipotoxic injury.
TLR4 and Innate Immunity
Toll like receptor signaling contributes to inflammation and fibrosis.
## Fibrosis Progression Models
Achieving significant fibrosis is challenging in mice:
### Accelerated Fibrosis Approaches
Extended Diet Duration
Prolonged feeding (24+ weeks) on obesogenic diets eventually produces fibrosis.
Choline Deficient Diets
CDHFD and similar formulations accelerate fibrosis development.
Genetic Susceptibility
Certain genetic modifications predispose to fibrosis on standard diets.
CCl4 Combination
Low dose carbon tetrachloride combined with diet accelerates fibrosis but introduces chemical injury.
### Hepatic Stellate Cell Models
Cell Specific Knockouts
LRAT Cre or Col1a1 Cre target hepatic stellate cells for fibrosis mechanism studies.
Activation Pathway Knockouts
TGF beta, PDGF, and other pro fibrotic pathway modifications.
## Model Design Considerations
### Background Strain Selection
Metabolic phenotypes are profoundly strain dependent:
C57BL/6
Susceptible to diet induced obesity and steatosis. Standard background for MASH studies.
C57BL/6J vs C57BL/6N
Substrains differ in metabolic phenotypes. C57BL/6J carries Nnt mutation affecting glucose metabolism.
129 Strains
Generally resistant to diet induced obesity but susceptible when combined with genetic modifications.
BALB/c
Different metabolic response than C57BL/6.

### Disease Induction Parameters
Diet Selection
Choose diet based on specific research question. MCD for rapid steatohepatitis without obesity. Western diet for metabolic syndrome context.
Duration
Simple steatosis develops in 8 to 12 weeks on HFD. Steatohepatitis requires 16 to 24 weeks. Fibrosis requires 24+ weeks or accelerating approaches.
Sex Differences
Male mice generally develop more severe disease than females on most dietary models.
### Cell Type Specific Approaches
MASH involves multiple liver cell types:
Hepatocyte Specific
Albumin Cre targets hepatocytes for studying cell autonomous lipid metabolism and injury responses.
Kupffer Cell/Macrophage
LysM Cre or CX3CR1 Cre targets resident and infiltrating macrophages for inflammation studies.
Hepatic Stellate Cell
LRAT Cre targets stellate cells for fibrosis mechanism studies.
Cholangiocyte
CK19 Cre or Sox9 Cre for bile duct contributions.
## Phenotyping MASH Models

## Frequently Asked Questions
What dietary models are used for MASH studies?
Common dietary models include high-fat diet (HFD), methionine-choline-deficient (MCD) diet, Western diet, and choline-deficient amino-acid defined (CDAA) diet. MCD diet rapidly induces steatohepatitis without obesity, while HFD models metabolic syndrome context. Selection depends on research question and timeline.
How do you model different stages of MASH progression?
Steatosis develops in 8-12 weeks on HFD, steatohepatitis requires 16-24 weeks, and fibrosis requires 24+ weeks or accelerating approaches. Genetic modifications can accelerate specific stages: combining conditional knockouts with dietary challenge enables study of mechanisms driving progression from steatosis to fibrosis.
What cell-type-specific approaches are used for MASH?
Hepatocyte-specific deletion uses Albumin-Cre for lipid metabolism studies. Macrophage/Kupffer cell deletion uses LysM-Cre or CX3CR1-Cre for inflammation studies. Hepatic stellate cell deletion uses LRAT-Cre for fibrosis mechanism studies. Cholangiocyte targeting uses CK19-Cre or Sox9-Cre.
Which mouse background is best for MASH studies?
C57BL/6 is the standard background for MASH studies due to susceptibility to diet-induced obesity and steatosis. Substrains differ: C57BL/6J carries Nnt mutation affecting glucose metabolism. C57BL/6N is commonly used and well-characterized. Both work, but consistency within a study is critical.
How long does it take to generate a MASH mouse model?
Standard custom model generation takes 26-36 weeks from project initiation to delivery of germline-transmitted founders. Conditional approaches for cell-type-specific studies follow the same timeline. Pre-germline characterization provides early validation of targeting before mouse generation.
