# Immuno-Oncology Mouse Models
Since 1998, Ingenious Targeting Laboratory has supported immuno-oncology researchers with custom mouse models contributing to peer reviewed publications in Cancer Research, Nature Medicine, Immunity, and leading oncology journals worldwide. Our immuno oncology mouse models have advanced understanding of tumor immunity, immune checkpoint biology, and the mechanisms underlying cancer immunotherapy response.
Immuno oncology mouse models enable researchers to investigate the complex interactions between tumors and the immune system, from T cell exhaustion and checkpoint regulation to tumor microenvironment dynamics. Humanized immune checkpoint models express human versions of PD1, PDL1, CTLA4, and other targets, allowing direct testing of clinical antibody candidates in immunocompetent mice.
The immuno oncology revolution has transformed cancer treatment, creating demand for sophisticated mouse models that support therapeutic development. Ingenious Targeting Laboratory designs and generates custom immuno oncology models tailored to your specific research questions and therapeutic programs.
## Humanized Immune Checkpoint Models
### Why Humanize Checkpoints
Many therapeutic antibodies targeting immune checkpoints are designed specifically for human proteins and show limited or no cross reactivity with mouse orthologs. Humanized checkpoint models express human versions of these targets, enabling:
Direct testing of clinical antibody candidates
Evaluation of antibody effector functions
Combination therapy optimization
Biomarker development and validation
Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies
### Available Checkpoint Targets
(/humanized-immune-checkpoint-mice)
### Single vs Dual Humanization
Checkpoint models can be generated as single target or combination humanized strains:
Single humanization:** One checkpoint target humanized for monotherapy studies
Dual humanization:** Two checkpoints humanized (e.g., PD1 + CTLA4) for combination studies
Multi target:** Three or more checkpoints for complex combination evaluation
Dual and multi humanized models support evaluation of combination immunotherapy approaches that target multiple checkpoint pathways simultaneously.

## Genetic Tumor Models
### Tumor Suppressor Knockouts
Conditional knockout of tumor suppressors enables controlled tumor development in immunocompetent hosts:
p53 conditional knockout:** Spontaneous tumor development in specific tissues
PTEN conditional knockout:** PI3K pathway activation, various tumor types
APC conditional knockout:** Intestinal tumor models
Rb conditional knockout:** Cell cycle dysregulation
Tissue specific Cre drivers restrict tumor development to clinically relevant locations while maintaining intact systemic immunity.
(/tumor-suppressor-knockout-mice)
### Oncogene Activation Models
Conditional expression of activated oncogenes enables controlled tumor initiation:
KRAS G12D knockin:** Lung and pancreatic tumor models
BRAF V600E knockin:** Melanoma and other tumor types
MYC overexpression:** Various tumor types
Fusion oncogenes:** Chromosomal translocation models
### Combining Genetic Models with Checkpoint Humanization
Genetic tumor models can be combined with humanized checkpoint alleles to create sophisticated platforms for immunotherapy evaluation:
Autochthonous tumors in checkpoint humanized hosts
Spontaneous tumor development with human checkpoint targets
Physiologically relevant tumor microenvironment
## Syngeneic Tumor Models
### Transplantable Tumor Systems
Syngeneic models involve transplantation of tumor cell lines into immunocompetent mice of matching genetic background:
### Checkpoint Humanized Syngeneic Models
Syngeneic tumor cells transplanted into checkpoint humanized mice enable rapid evaluation of clinical antibody candidates:
Human PD1/PDL1 engagement in tumor microenvironment
Anti human checkpoint antibody efficacy testing
Combination therapy optimization
Resistance mechanism studies
(/syngeneic-tumor-models)
## Model Types for Immuno Oncology
### Humanized Knockin Models
Humanized checkpoint knockins replace mouse genes with human orthologs at the endogenous locus:
Physiological expression levels
Normal tissue distribution
Endogenous regulatory control
Maintained immune system function
(/humanized-mouse-models)
### Conditional Knockout Models
Conditional knockouts enable tissue specific or temporal gene manipulation:
Immune cell specific deletions (T cell, B cell, myeloid)
Tumor cell specific deletions
Inducible knockouts modeling therapeutic intervention
Target validation through genetic ablation
(/conditional-knockout-mouse-models)
### Reporter Models
Reporter knockins enable visualization and tracking of immune cells:
Fluorescent reporters for immune cell tracking
Luciferase reporters for in vivo imaging
Lineage tracing of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes
Real time monitoring of immune activation
(/reporter-knockin)
## Technical Considerations
### Pre Germline Characterization
ES cell based targeting enables comprehensive characterization of immuno oncology alleles before mouse generation. This pre germline analysis confirms correct human sequence integration, proper allele structure, and absence of random integration events.
For humanized checkpoint models, sequence verification confirms exact human sequence incorporation. Functional testing can verify human specific antibody binding in ES cells prior to mouse production.
### Strain Background Considerations
Strain background affects immune phenotypes and syngeneic tumor compatibility:
C57BL/6:** Th1 biased, compatible with MC38, B16, LLC
BALB/c:** Th2 biased, compatible with CT26, 4T1, EMT6
Mixed backgrounds:** May affect immune responses and tumor growth
Choose strain background based on syngeneic tumor line compatibility and desired immune phenotype.
(/c57bl6-mouse-background)
### Combining Multiple Modifications
Complex immuno oncology models may require multiple genetic modifications:
Dual checkpoint humanization (PD1 + CTLA4)
Checkpoint humanization plus oncogene activation
Multiple immune cell modifications
Reporter plus functional modifications
Our scientific team advises on breeding strategies and allele combinations for complex model generation.

## Frequently Asked Questions
Why do I need humanized checkpoint models for immunotherapy testing?
Most checkpoint inhibitor antibodies target human proteins and do not cross-react with mouse orthologs. Humanized checkpoint models express human PD1, PDL1, CTLA4, or other targets, enabling efficacy testing of clinical antibodies in immunocompetent mice with functional immune systems. This is essential for preclinical immunotherapy development.
What is the difference between single and dual checkpoint humanization?
Single checkpoint models (e.g., PD1 humanized) enable testing of monotherapy antibodies. Dual checkpoint models (e.g., PD1/CTLA4 humanized) enable testing of combination immunotherapy, which is increasingly important in clinical practice. Dual humanization requires combining multiple humanized alleles through breeding.
Can I use humanized checkpoint models with syngeneic tumors?
Yes. Humanized checkpoint models on C57BL/6 or BALB/c backgrounds are compatible with syngeneic tumor lines (MC38, B16, CT26, 4T1). This enables testing of checkpoint inhibitors in immunocompetent mice with functional immune systems, providing more physiologically relevant data than immunodeficient models.
How do genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) compare to syngeneic tumor models for immuno-oncology?
GEMMs develop tumors spontaneously from defined genetic alterations and better recapitulate tumor evolution and microenvironment. Syngeneic models involve injecting established tumor cell lines and are faster for screening studies. Both approaches have value: GEMMs for mechanism studies, syngeneic models for rapid immunotherapy screening.
What strain background should I use for immuno-oncology studies?
C57BL/6 is most common for Th1-biased immune responses and compatibility with MC38 and B16 syngeneic tumors. BALB/c is preferred for Th2-biased responses and CT26/4T1 tumors. Strain selection affects immune phenotype and tumor growth, so choose based on your experimental requirements and syngeneic tumor compatibility.
