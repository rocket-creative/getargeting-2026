# Custom Mouse Models
Since 1998, Ingenious Targeting Laboratory has completed over 2,500 custom gene targeting projects for academic institutions, pharmaceutical companies, and biotech organizations worldwide. Our mouse model generation services have contributed to more than 800 peer reviewed publications across every major therapeutic area.
Whether you need a simple knockout to eliminate gene function, a conditional allele for tissue specific studies, a knockin model to introduce precise modifications, or a humanized mouse for translational research, Ingenious Targeting Laboratory provides the scientific expertise and technical infrastructure to bring your project from concept to study ready animals.
## Mouse Model Types
### Knockout Mouse Models
Knockout mice enable loss of function studies by eliminating specific gene activity. Ingenious Targeting Laboratory offers both conventional knockouts for complete gene inactivation and conditional knockouts that allow spatial and temporal control of gene deletion.
Conventional Knockout Models permanently disrupt target gene function in all tissues throughout development, ideal for understanding essential gene function and creating disease models where complete loss of function is required.
Conditional Knockout Models use the Cre lox system to enable gene deletion in specific tissues or at defined timepoints, essential for studying genes with embryonic lethal phenotypes or investigating tissue specific gene function.

### Knockin Mouse Models
Knockin mice introduce precise genetic modifications at defined loci, enabling reporter expression, point mutations, tag insertions, and gene humanization strategies.
cDNA Knockin Models replace endogenous genes with alternative coding sequences, enabling expression of modified or humanized genes under endogenous regulatory control.
Point Mutation Models introduce specific nucleotide changes to model human disease variants or study protein function with surgical precision.
Reporter Knockin Models insert fluorescent proteins, enzymatic reporters, or other detection systems to visualize gene expression patterns and cell populations in vivo.

### Humanized Mouse Models
Humanized mice replace mouse genes or gene segments with their human counterparts, creating translational platforms for therapeutic development and human disease modeling.
Gene Replacement Models substitute entire mouse genes with human orthologs, enabling testing of human specific therapeutics and studying human gene function in vivo.
Immune Checkpoint Humanization creates mice expressing human PD1, PDL1, CTLA4, LAG3, TIM3, and other checkpoint molecules for immunotherapy development.
Receptor and Cytokine Humanization enables preclinical testing of biologics targeting human proteins that lack mouse cross reactivity.

### Transgenic Mouse Models
Transgenic mice carry additional genetic sequences integrated into the genome, enabling overexpression studies, reporter lines, and Cre driver strains.
Ingenious Targeting Laboratory's targeted transgenic approach uses safe harbor loci including Rosa26, HPRT, and Polr2a to achieve predictable, single copy integration with stable expression across generations.

## Advanced Technologies
### Conditional Gene Targeting
Ingenious Targeting Laboratory specializes in conditional allele design using the Cre lox recombination system. Our derivative allele approach creates flexible alleles that can generate multiple model types from a single targeted ES cell clone.
The tm1a knockout first allele can be converted to:
tm1b complete null allele (LacZ reporter intact)
tm1c conditional ready floxed allele (gene function restored)
tm1d tissue specific null (after Cre mediated recombination)
This flexibility maximizes research value while minimizing project timelines and costs.

## Strain Background Options
Ingenious Targeting Laboratory generates custom models on the genetic background most appropriate for your research goals:
C57BL/6 remains the most widely used inbred strain, with extensive phenotypic data and compatibility with most disease models.
BALB/c offers advantages for immunology research and certain tumor models.
129 Strain ES cells provide exceptional targeting efficiency for complex allele designs.
Mixed Backgrounds can be backcrossed to your preferred strain following model generation.

## What Researchers Say
"The Hephaestin flox model made by Ingenious is now the basis for eight research publications from multiple research groups in three countries."

— **Joshua Dunaief, MD, PhD**, University of Pennsylvania

“I’ve been working with iTL over the past 5 years in the production of 3 different genetically altered mice. Not only did iTL help in the design of the mice, but the entire process was transparent with the opportunity at any time along the way to discuss my questions or concerns with scientists who had significant insight into the process. The mice were delivered on time, as billed!”
— **Raghu Mirmira, MD/Phd**, University of Chicago
