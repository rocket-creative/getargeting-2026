# Conditional Knockin Mice
Conditional knockin mouse models enable controlled gene expression through Cre lox mediated recombination. Since 1998, Ingenious Targeting Laboratory has generated conditional knockin models for inducible reporter expression, tissue specific gene activation, and temporal control of gene function.
Conditional knockin alleles are designed with loxP sites flanking a STOP cassette that prevents expression until Cre mediated recombination removes the STOP sequence. This approach enables spatial and temporal control over gene expression, essential for studying genes with developmental effects or when expression timing is critical.
## How Conditional Knockin Works
### Allele Design
Conditional knockin alleles contain:
loxP Sites**: Flank the STOP cassette
STOP Cassette**: Prevents expression until removed
Knockin Sequence**: Gene, reporter, or tag to be expressed
Endogenous Promoter**: Native regulatory control
### Activation Mechanism
Cre mediated recombination:
Removes STOP cassette
Activates knockin expression
Maintains endogenous regulation
Provides permanent activation
## Applications
### Inducible Reporter Expression
Conditional knockin enables:
Temporal reporter activation
Tissue specific visualization
Lineage tracing initiation
Expression pattern studies
### Controlled Gene Expression
Temporal gene activation:
Adult gene expression
Disease modeling
Therapeutic intervention studies
Developmental timing studies
### Tag Activation
Conditional tag expression:
Temporal protein tagging
Tissue specific labeling
Biochemical studies
Localization analysis
## Design Considerations
### Cre Driver Selection
Choose appropriate Cre lines:
Tissue specific Cre for spatial control
Inducible Cre for temporal control
Ubiquitous Cre for global activation
Multiple Cre lines for different applications
(/cre-line-selection-guide)
### Expression Timing
Consider when activation is needed:
Embryonic activation
Postnatal activation
Adult activation
Inducible activation

## Frequently Asked Questions
What is the difference between conditional knockin and regular knockin?
Conditional knockin models include loxP-flanked stop cassettes or other conditional elements that prevent expression until Cre-mediated recombination occurs. This enables tissue-specific or temporal control of knockin expression. Regular knockin models express the inserted sequence constitutively in all tissues.
When should I use conditional knockin instead of standard knockin?
Use conditional knockin when the inserted sequence (e.g., point mutation, reporter, humanized gene) would cause lethality or severe phenotypes if expressed globally, or when you need tissue-specific or temporal control. Conditional knockin enables study of gene function in specific cell types or at specific timepoints.
How do you control conditional knockin expression?
Expression is controlled through Cre recombinase. Tissue-specific Cre drivers enable spatial control. Tamoxifen-inducible Cre (CreER) enables temporal control. After Cre-mediated recombination, the conditional element is removed and expression begins. Expression is permanent once recombination occurs.
What types of sequences can be conditionally inserted?
Conditional knockin can insert point mutations, reporters (GFP, luciferase), epitope tags, humanized gene sequences, or cDNA sequences. The conditional cassette (loxP-flanked stop) prevents expression until Cre recombination removes it, enabling controlled expression of the inserted sequence.
What is the timeline for generating a conditional knockin model?
Custom model generation takes 6-10 months from project initiation to identification of germline-transmitted mice.
