# Therapeutic Area Mouse Models
Since 1998, Ingenious Targeting Laboratory has generated custom mouse models supporting research across every major therapeutic area. Our 2,500+ completed projects span oncology, neuroscience, metabolic disease, immunology, cardiovascular research, rare disease, and ophthalmology, contributing to over 800 peer reviewed publications.
Whether you are studying disease mechanisms, validating therapeutic targets, or testing drug candidates, Ingenious Targeting Laboratory provides the custom knockout, knockin, and humanized models optimized for your specific disease research needs.
## Oncology Mouse Models
Cancer research requires models that accurately recapitulate tumor biology, immune interactions, and therapeutic responses. Ingenious Targeting Laboratory supports oncology programs with tumor suppressor knockouts, oncogene models, and humanized immune checkpoint mice for immuno oncology studies.
### Key Applications
Tumor suppressor knockout models enable study of cancer initiation and progression. Conditional approaches allow tissue specific or temporal control over tumor development, while germline knockouts model inherited cancer syndromes.
Immuno oncology research benefits from humanized checkpoint models including PD1, PDL1, CTLA4, LAG3, and TIM3 humanized mice. These models enable preclinical testing of checkpoint inhibitor antibodies in immunocompetent mice.

## Neuroscience Mouse Models
Neurological and neurodegenerative disease research demands models that reproduce disease pathology while enabling mechanistic studies. Ingenious Targeting Laboratory has generated models for Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, ALS, Huntington disease, epilepsy, autism spectrum disorders, and other neurological conditions.
### Key Applications
Alzheimer disease models incorporate mutations in APP, presenilin genes, or tau to study amyloid pathology, tauopathy, and neurodegeneration. Conditional approaches enable temporal control over pathology onset.
Movement disorder research uses alpha synuclein models for Parkinson disease, SOD1 or TDP43 models for ALS, and huntingtin models for Huntington disease. Reporter knockins enable cell population tracking in neural circuits.

## Metabolic Disease Mouse Models
Metabolic research spans diabetes, obesity, fatty liver disease, and lipid metabolism disorders. Ingenious Targeting Laboratory provides models for studying metabolic pathways, testing therapeutic interventions, and understanding disease progression.
### Key Applications
Diabetes models address both type 1 autoimmune mechanisms and type 2 insulin resistance and beta cell dysfunction. Tissue specific knockouts in liver, adipose, muscle, or pancreas reveal organ specific contributions to metabolic disease.
NASH and obesity research benefits from models that develop hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis when challenged with appropriate diets. Humanized models enable testing of human specific therapeutic targets.

## Immunology Mouse Models
Immune system research requires models that accurately reflect human immunology while enabling mechanistic studies. Ingenious Targeting Laboratory supports autoimmune disease research, inflammatory conditions, and basic immunology with knockout, knockin, and humanized models.
### Key Applications
Autoimmune disease models enable study of conditions including rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, multiple sclerosis, and inflammatory bowel disease. Conditional knockouts in specific immune cell populations reveal cell type specific contributions.
Humanized immune models express human cytokines, receptors, or immune checkpoints, enabling testing of human specific immunotherapies in mice with functional immune systems.

## Cardiovascular Mouse Models
Cardiovascular research encompasses atherosclerosis, heart failure, hypertension, cardiac fibrosis, and vascular disease. Ingenious Targeting Laboratory provides models for studying cardiovascular pathophysiology and testing therapeutic approaches.
### Key Applications
Atherosclerosis models often combine lipid metabolism gene modifications with apolipoprotein E or LDL receptor deficiency backgrounds. Conditional knockouts enable tissue specific studies in endothelium, smooth muscle, or macrophages.
Cardiac disease models address heart failure, arrhythmia, and fibrosis through modification of ion channels, sarcomeric proteins, or signaling pathway components.
(/cardiovascular-mouse-models)
## Rare Disease Mouse Models
Rare and orphan diseases affect small patient populations but often have high unmet need for effective therapies. Ingenious Targeting Laboratory supports rare disease research with models for muscular dystrophies, lysosomal storage disorders, cystic fibrosis, and other inherited conditions.
### Key Applications
Muscular dystrophy models carry mutations in dystrophin, dysferlin, or other muscle proteins. These models enable study of disease mechanisms and testing of gene therapy or exon skipping approaches.
Lysosomal storage disorder models reproduce enzyme deficiencies that cause substrate accumulation and cellular dysfunction, providing platforms for enzyme replacement and gene therapy development.

## Ophthalmology Mouse Models
Vision research addresses retinal degenerations, glaucoma, macular degeneration, and other ocular conditions. Ingenious Targeting Laboratory provides models for studying photoreceptor biology, retinal pigment epithelium function, and visual pathway development.
### Key Applications
Retinal degeneration models carry mutations in rhodopsin, peripherin, or other photoreceptor genes. Conditional approaches enable temporal control over degeneration onset for therapeutic intervention studies.
Reporter knockins enable visualization of specific retinal cell populations and tracking of cell fate during development and disease.

## Frequently Asked Questions
What types of mouse models are available for different therapeutic areas?
Therapeutic area models include knockout models (loss-of-function studies), knockin models (point mutations, reporters, humanized sequences), conditional models (tissue-specific or temporal control), and humanized models (for therapeutic testing). Selection depends on disease mechanism, research question, and therapeutic strategy.
How do you select the right model type for a therapeutic area?
Model type selection depends on research question: use knockout for loss-of-function studies, knockin for patient mutations or reporters, conditional for tissue-specific studies or essential genes, and humanized for therapeutic testing requiring human targets. ITL's scientific consultants help match model type to research goals.
Can models be combined across therapeutic areas?
Yes. Models can be combined across therapeutic areas for multi-disease studies, comorbidity research, or complex disease modeling. For example, metabolic disease models can be combined with cardiovascular models, or oncology models can be combined with immunology models for immuno-oncology research.
How do therapeutic area models support drug development?
Therapeutic area models support drug development through target validation (confirming target relevance), efficacy testing (preclinical evaluation of drug candidates), biomarker discovery (identifying disease markers), and safety assessment (evaluating on-target and off-target effects). Humanized models enable testing of human-specific therapeutics.
