# Point Mutation Mouse Models
Since 1998, Ingenious Targeting Laboratory has generated hundreds of point mutation mouse models for researchers studying disease mechanisms, protein function, and therapeutic development. Our mouse models have supported research published more than 800 peer reviewed articles, including in Science, Nature, and Cell.
Point mutation mice carry specific nucleotide changes at endogenous genomic loci, expressing variant proteins under normal regulatory control. Unlike overexpression systems, point mutation knockin models maintain physiological expression levels and tissue distribution, providing the most accurate representation of how disease associated variants affect gene function in vivo.
From modeling human disease variants to introducing phosphorylation site mutations for signaling studies, point mutation mice enable precise examination of how specific amino acid changes affect protein function, organismal phenotypes, and disease pathogenesis.
## Applications of Point Mutation Models
### Disease Variant Modeling
Human genetic studies identify disease associated variants, but understanding how these variants cause disease requires functional models:
GWAS variants:** Model SNPs identified in genome wide association studies
Mendelian disease mutations:** Reproduce mutations causing inherited disorders
Cancer driver mutations:** Express oncogenic point mutations at endogenous loci
Pharmacogenomic variants:** Model variants affecting drug response
Point mutation knockin provides definitive evidence linking specific variants to phenotypic outcomes.
### Protein Function Studies
Point mutations enable precise dissection of protein function:
Catalytic site mutations:** Abolish enzymatic activity while preserving protein expression
Phosphorylation site mutations:** Block or mimic phosphorylation to study signaling
Binding site mutations:** Disrupt specific protein-protein or protein-ligand interactions
Domain function:** Identify essential residues within functional domains
### Drug Target Modeling
Point mutation models support therapeutic development:
Resistance mutations:** Model drug resistance variants for next generation compound development
Humanized binding sites:** Enable testing of human specific therapeutics
Gain of function variants:** Model activating mutations as therapeutic targets
## Types of Point Mutations
### Missense Mutations
Single nucleotide changes that alter the encoded amino acid:
Most common type of disease associated coding variant
May affect protein folding, stability, or function
Phenotypic severity varies from silent to lethal
### Nonsense Mutations
Single nucleotide changes that create premature stop codons:
Typically result in truncated, non functional proteins
May trigger nonsense mediated decay
Model loss of function alleles
### Silent Mutations
Nucleotide changes that do not alter the encoded amino acid:
Create restriction sites for genotyping
Serve as linked markers for allele tracking
Control for targeting procedure effects
### Regulatory Mutations
Changes in non coding regulatory sequences:
Promoter or enhancer variants affecting expression level
Splice site variants affecting transcript processing
UTR variants affecting mRNA stability or translation
## Common Point Mutation Applications
### Phosphorylation Site Mutations
### Common Disease Mutations
### Catalytic Site Mutations
Mutations that abolish enzymatic activity while preserving protein expression enable study of non catalytic protein functions:
Kinase dead mutations (K→R in ATP binding site)
Protease dead mutations (active site residue changes)
Phosphatase dead mutations (catalytic cysteine changes)
## Technical Approach
### Allele Design Options
Point mutation alleles can be designed with varying complexity:
Simple knockin:** Point mutation only
Conditional point mutation:** loxP flanked wildtype exon enables Cre mediated conversion to mutant.
Inducible point mutation:** Combine with inducible Cre for temporal control
Dual reporter:** Fluorescent markers distinguish wildtype from mutant expressing cells
## Experimental Considerations
### Homozygous vs Heterozygous Analysis
Consider the genetics of your disease or question:
Dominant mutations:** Heterozygotes may show phenotype; homozygotes may be more severe or lethal
Recessive mutations:** Homozygotes required for phenotype
Haploinsufficiency:** Heterozygotes show partial phenotype
Gain of function:** One copy may suffice for full effect
### Strain Background
Strain background can modify point mutation phenotypes:
Generate on C57BL/6 for consistency with most published literature
Consider strain specific modifiers for disease relevant backgrounds
Maintain consistent background for comparisons
(/c57bl6-mouse-background)
### Controls
Appropriate controls for point mutation studies:
Wildtype littermates:** Same genetic background without mutation
Heterozygous carriers:** Intermediate genotype for dosage studies
Parallel knockouts:** Compare point mutation to complete loss of function

## Frequently Asked Questions
Can point mutations be introduced without disrupting normal gene expression?
Yes. Point mutation knockins change specific nucleotides while preserving all other gene sequences.
What types of point mutations can be modeled?
Any single or multiple nucleotide change can be modeled, including disease-associated variants, catalytic site mutations (kinase dead, protease dead), phosphorylation site mutations, and regulatory element mutations. Point mutations enable precise study of how specific amino acid changes affect protein function and disease phenotypes.
Can point mutations be made conditional?
Yes. Point mutations can be designed as conditional alleles using loxP-flanked wildtype exons. Cre-mediated recombination converts wildtype to mutant sequence, enabling temporal or tissue-specific control over mutation expression. This is valuable for modeling mutations that would be lethal if expressed globally from conception.
What is the difference between homozygous and heterozygous point mutation models?
Heterozygous models are used for dominant mutations or haploinsufficiency studies. Homozygous models are required for recessive mutations. Some mutations show dose-dependent effects where heterozygotes show partial phenotypes and homozygotes show more severe or lethal phenotypes. Genetic analysis determines whether heterozygotes or homozygotes are appropriate.
