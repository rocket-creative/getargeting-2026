# cDNA Knockin Mouse Models
Since 1998, ingenious targeting laboratory has generated hundreds of cDNA knockin mouse models, providing researchers with tools for gene replacement, expression modification, and functional studies where insertion of complete coding sequences is required.
cDNA knockin models enable expression of modified gene products, replacement with orthologs or variants, and insertion of complete coding sequences at endogenous loci for physiologically regulated expression.
## What Is a cDNA Knockin?
A cDNA knockin inserts a complementary DNA sequence (coding sequence without introns) at a specific genomic locus, typically the endogenous gene location, placing the cDNA under endogenous regulatory control.
### Key Characteristics
Complete Coding Sequence
The entire protein coding region is inserted as a contiguous sequence without introns.
Endogenous Regulation
When knocked into the native locus, the cDNA is expressed under control of the endogenous promoter and regulatory elements.
Defined Isoform
The inserted cDNA specifies a single isoform, eliminating alternative splicing complexity.
Fusion Capability
Tags, reporters, or additional sequences can be fused to the cDNA.
## Applications of cDNA Knockin
### Humanization
Replace mouse genes with human orthologs:
Therapeutic Target Humanization
Human protein expression enables testing of human specific therapeutics such as antibodies.
Disease Modeling
Human genes containing pathogenic mutations model human genetic diseases.
Pharmacokinetic Studies
Human metabolic enzymes enable human relevant drug metabolism studies.
Immunogenicity Considerations
Human proteins avoid immune responses that might occur against mouse proteins in humanized immune system models.

### Isoform Specific Expression
Study specific transcript variants:
Alternative Splicing
Different splice isoforms can be expressed from separate knockin alleles to study isoform specific functions.
Dominant Isoform Studies
Express the predominant isoform without interference from minor variants.
Tissue Specific Variants
Some genes produce tissue specific isoforms; cDNA knockin ensures expression of the desired form.
### Reporter Fusions
Create functional reporter alleles:
Fluorescent Protein Fusions
C terminal or N terminal fusion of GFP, mCherry, or other fluorescent proteins enables protein localization and expression monitoring.
Epitope Tags
FLAG, HA, V5, or other tags enable biochemical detection and purification.
Enzymatic Tags
Luciferase, beta galactosidase, or other reporters for functional studies.
### Conditional Expression
Combine cDNA knockin with conditional systems:
Cre Dependent Expression
LoxP-stop-LoxP cassette upstream of cDNA blocks expression until Cre activation.
Replacement Strategies
Express cDNA conditionally to replace knockout of endogenous gene.
## Design Considerations
### Insertion Site Selection
ATG Replacement
Insert cDNA at the translational start site, replacing the first exon. Allows native transcriptional initiation.
First Exon Replacement
Replace entire first coding exon with cDNA cassette.
Stop Codon Insertion
For C terminal fusions, insert at the native stop codon position.
### Regulatory Elements
Kozak Sequence
Include appropriate Kozak consensus for efficient translation initiation.
Polyadenylation
Include polyadenylation signal if the knockin cassette does not read through to endogenous 3' UTR.
Splice Signals
If inserting into an intron, include splice acceptor or other elements as needed.
## cDNA Knockin vs Genomic Knockin
Compare approaches for gene replacement:
### When to Choose cDNA Knockin
Gene has complex splicing not required for study
Human cDNA replacement is the goal
Adding fusion proteins or tags
Simpler construct design preferred
Insert size constraints
### When to Choose Genomic Knockin
Alternative splicing is important
Intronic regulatory elements are critical
Most physiological expression is essential
Point mutation knockin (genomic is simpler)
## Expression Considerations
### Potential for Altered Expression
Intron Removal Effects
Introns can affect transcription, mRNA stability, and nuclear export. cDNA may show different expression levels than genomic constructs.
Regulatory Element Loss
Intronic enhancers or other regulatory elements are lost in cDNA knockins.
mRNA Stability
3' UTR sequences affect mRNA half life. Design should consider whether to include native or synthetic 3' UTR.
### Mitigation Strategies
Expression Validation
Verify protein expression levels in knockin animals match expectations.
Functional Testing
Confirm knockin allele is functional through phenotypic analysis.
Heterozygous Analysis
Compare heterozygotes to assess whether one knockin allele provides sufficient expression.

## Frequently Asked Questions
When should I choose cDNA knockin over genomic knockin?
Choose cDNA knockin when you need to replace the coding sequence with an alternative (human gene, modified sequence, or isoform). cDNA knockins bypass introns and alternative splicing. Choose genomic knockin (with introns) when alternative splicing is important, intronic regulatory elements are critical, or for point mutations where genomic targeting is simpler.
Can cDNA knockins express at physiological levels?
Yes. cDNA knockins at the endogenous locus maintain native promoter and regulatory elements, providing physiological expression levels. This is an advantage over transgenic approaches which often overexpress. Expression levels depend on promoter strength and regulatory context, which are preserved in knockin approaches.
What is conditional cDNA knockin and when is it used?
Conditional cDNA knockin uses a LoxP-flanked stop cassette that prevents expression until Cre recombination. This enables tissue-specific or temporally controlled expression of cDNA sequences. It's valuable when cDNA expression would be lethal if expressed globally from conception, such as oncogenic mutations or toxic proteins.
What size cDNA can be knocked in?
Typical cDNA knockins range from <1 kb to 5-6 kb. Large cDNAs (>6 kb) may require specialized approaches or BAC-based targeting. Our scientific team evaluates cDNA size and complexity during project consultation to recommend optimal strategies.
