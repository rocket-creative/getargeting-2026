# Humanized Mouse Models
Since 1998, Ingenious Targeting Laboratory has generated hundreds of humanized mouse models for researchers and pharmaceutical companies worldwide. Our humanized models have supported therapeutic development programs across immuno-oncology, metabolic disease, neuroscience, and other areas, with results published in peer reviewed journals.
Humanized mouse models express human proteins or protein domains in place of their mouse counterparts. This humanization enables testing of human specific therapeutics, study of human specific biology, and improved translation from preclinical models to clinical outcomes. When therapeutic antibodies or biologics are designed specifically for human targets, humanized mice provide the only way to evaluate efficacy in an immunocompetent in vivo system.
From single domain humanization for antibody epitope testing to complete gene replacement for comprehensive human biology studies, Ingenious Targeting Laboratory designs humanized models tailored to your specific research and therapeutic development requirements.
## Why Humanize Mouse Genes
### Species Specific Therapeutics
Many therapeutic antibodies and biologics are designed specifically for human targets:
Therapeutic antibodies may not cross react with mouse orthologs
Human specific epitopes require human sequence for binding
Biologics may have species specific receptor interactions
Humanized models enable efficacy testing of clinical candidates
### Translational Relevance
Humanized models improve translation to clinical outcomes:
Study human specific protein functions
Model human specific disease mechanisms
Evaluate pharmacokinetics with human target engagement
Develop and validate human specific biomarkers
### Regulatory Considerations
Humanized models support regulatory submissions:
Demonstrate on target efficacy with human target
Evaluate safety in context of human target biology
Support mechanism of action characterization
Enable pharmacodynamic biomarker development
## Humanization Strategies
### Complete Gene Replacement
The entire mouse gene is replaced with the human ortholog:
Human coding sequence under mouse regulatory control
Preserves mouse expression pattern and level
Enables study of all human specific protein features
Most comprehensive humanization approach
Complete replacement is appropriate when the entire protein sequence differs functionally between species or when studying human specific splice variants.
### Extracellular Domain Humanization
Human extracellular domain replaces mouse sequence while retaining mouse intracellular domain:
Human epitopes for antibody binding
Mouse signaling domains for normal downstream function
Commonly used for immune checkpoint humanization
Maintains compatibility with mouse immune system
This approach is ideal for therapeutic antibody testing where the antibody targets extracellular epitopes.
### Specific Domain or Epitope Humanization
Only the specific region recognized by the therapeutic is humanized:
Minimal sequence change
Preserves most mouse protein function
Targeted to specific antibody epitope
May require epitope mapping data
### Humanized Regulatory Elements
Human promoter or enhancer sequences replace mouse regulatory regions:
Study human specific gene regulation
Model human expression patterns
Investigate human specific enhancer variants
### TruHumanization™ Technology
Ingenious Targeting Laboratory's proprietary TruHumanization™ technology optimizes humanization strategies for maximum therapeutic relevance and physiological compatibility with complete gene replacement.
Quality Assurance: All TruHumanization™ projects include pre-germline analysis to verify correct human sequence integration before mouse generation.
## Applications by Therapeutic Area
### Immuno Oncology
Humanized immune checkpoint models are essential for cancer immunotherapy development:
Dual humanized models (e.g., PD1 + CTLA4) enable combination immunotherapy evaluation.

### Metabolic Disease
Humanized metabolic targets support therapeutic development:
Humanized receptors for peptide therapeutic testing (GLP1R, GCGR)
Humanized enzymes for small molecule drug development
Humanized lipoproteins for cardiovascular studies
Humanized transporters for pharmacokinetic evaluation
(/metabolic-disease-mouse-models)
### Neuroscience
Humanized CNS targets enable neurotherapeutic development:
Humanized amyloid precursor protein (APP) for Alzheimer studies
Humanized tau (MAPT) for tauopathy research
Humanized receptors for antibody or biologic testing
Humanized ion channels for species specific pharmacology
(/alzheimers-mouse-models)
### Infectious Disease
Humanized receptors enable infection and therapeutic studies:
Humanized viral entry receptors
Humanized immune components for vaccine studies
Humanized targets for antiviral therapeutic testing
### Strain Background
Choose strain background based on experimental requirements:
C57BL/6:** Most common, compatible with syngeneic tumor models (MC38, B16)
BALB/c:** Alternative background, compatible with CT26, 4T1 tumors
Immunodeficient backgrounds:** For human immune cell engraftment studies
(/c57bl6-mouse-background)
### Combining Multiple Humanizations
Complex models may require multiple humanized genes:
Dual checkpoint humanization (PD1 + CTLA4, PD1 + LAG3)
Receptor ligand pairs (CD47 + SIRPα)
Pathway components (multiple targets in same pathway)
Breeding strategies or sequential targeting can combine multiple humanized alleles.

## Frequently Asked Questions
Why do I need a humanized mouse model for drug development?
Many therapeutic antibodies and biologics are designed to target human proteins and do not cross-react with mouse orthologs. Humanized mice express human target proteins, enabling efficacy testing of human-specific therapeutics in an immunocompetent mouse with a functional immune system.
What is the difference between full gene replacement and extracellular domain humanization?
Full gene replacement substitutes the entire mouse gene with human sequence, including regulatory elements. Extracellular domain humanization replaces only the portion of the protein that therapeutic antibodies recognize, while preserving mouse intracellular domains for proper signaling. ECD humanization is often sufficient for antibody testing and may be faster to generate.
Can I combine multiple humanized genes in one mouse?
Yes. Dual or triple humanized mice are commonly used for combination therapy studies. For example, PD1/CTLA4 double humanized mice enable testing of dual checkpoint blockade. Multiple humanizations can be combined through breeding or sequential targeting.
Which humanized immune checkpoint models are available?
Ingenious Targeting Laboratory offers humanized models for PD1, PDL1, CTLA4, LAG3, and TIM3, and others, as well as combinations. These models express human checkpoint proteins recognized by clinical antibodies while maintaining functional mouse immune systems for syngeneic tumor studies.
