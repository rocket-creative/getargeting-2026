# p53 Humanized Mouse Models

## Customizable and regulatable p53 mutations: convenient, validated, and cost-effective

ingenious targeting laboratory has developed over 100 p53 humanized mouse models. Using our elegant targeting system, investigators studying the p53 gene and relevant protein pathways now have at their fingertips a suite of validated, cost effective products at their disposal.

These time-saving ready-made models offer the opportunity to gain new insights into cancer, as well as other diseases and conditions in which p53 has implications including neurodegenerative disorders, certain autoimmune diseases, and developmental abnormalities.

## What Researchers Say

> "iTL generated a conventional knockout mouse for my lab. The entire process was smooth and the quality of service provided by the iTL team and our project manager was exceptional. Several other researchers in my Center are creating mice with iTL and all of us have been extremely satisfied. I strongly recommend iTL for generation of your next mouse model!!!"

## Vector Overview

Mutations occur in the DNA binding domain of human exons 4-9 in the p53 gene

## Benefits

- Cost-effective
- Time savings – pre-made vectors in as little as 2 weeks, custom vectors and targeted ES cell lines in 8-10 weeks

## Resources

The information regarding these targeting vectors, including the detailed design down to the base pairs, can be visualized online.

### Technology Validation

Hanel W, Marchenko N, Xu S, Yu SX, Weng W, Moll U. 2013. Two hot spot mutant p53 mouse models display differential gain of function in tumorigenesis. Cell Death Differ 20(7): 898-909.
