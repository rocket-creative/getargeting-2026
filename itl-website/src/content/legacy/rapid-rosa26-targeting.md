# Rapid-Rosa26™ Targeting technology

## Targeted transgenic mice using the Rosa26 locus.

Rapid-Rosa26™ Targeting technology is ingenious' solution to the call for custom targeted transgenic models with shorter production timelines and reduced cost, without compromising performance and quality.

We utilize well-validated gene targeting strategies combined with our ready-to-go enhancing vectors to ensure delivery of your expression cassette or cDNA to the Rosa26 locus in record time.

This approach offers predictable targeting, increased accuracy, and stable gene expression without perturbing endogenous genes. You benefit from streamlined model generation, lower costs, and the flexibility to achieve constitutive or conditional gene expression, enhancing research efficiency and also reproducibility.

## What Researchers Say

> "I am very happy with iTL's mouse knockout services. It was pleasant to collaborate with my project manager. She was very thorough and communicative, an excellent combination. I will certainly use iTL again when needed, and I'm happy to share my positive experience with colleagues."

## Rapid-Rosa26™ Targeting: Improving Targeted Transgenics

Transgenic mouse models have helped to advance our understanding of biology, disease, and medicine for decades and will continue to play a significant role in the basic and biomedical research fields.

When generating a new model a major question is whether to employ random genomic integration or to create a targeted transgenic line. Targeted transgenics offer the advantage of precise gene targeting and copy number control, but at increased time and cost when compared to random transgenics.

Now with Rapid-Rosa26™ Targeting from ingenious targeting laboratory the costs of targeted transgenics are dramatically lowered.

## Introducing ingenious' Rapid-Rosa26™ Targeting Models

Rapid-Rosa26™ Targeting models are ingenious' solution to the call for custom targeted transgenic models with shorter production timelines and reduced cost, without compromising performance and quality.

We utilize well validated gene targeting strategies combined with our ready-to-go vectors to deliver your expression cassette or cDNA to the Rosa26 safe harbor locus in record time.

By combining these technologies, we generate precisely targeted, custom transgenic mouse models with a variety of expression possibilities at up to **25% reduced time and cost** when compared to traditional targeted knockin models.

## Enhancing Cassette Options

Our Rapid-Rosa26™ Targeting models can be custom designed with the following traditional and novel expression strategies:

- Incorporate our proprietary F.A.S.T.™ cassette, enabling inducible/reversible expression control of your cDNA
- loxP flanked, removable stop cassette for tissue specific expression
- Tissue specific promoters to control expression
- Reporter or tag cassettes for co-expression with your cDNA
- Tetracycline system expression cassettes for use with inducible models
- Custom designs according to your specifications

## Rapid-Rosa26™ technology provides:

- More flexibility and intuitive designs that are not limited by insertion size constraints
- More efficient insertion rates when compared to classical CRISPR embryo injection
- Better timelines than traditional Rosa26 targeting
- Pricing that fits your budget
