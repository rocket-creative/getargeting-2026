# Humanize your Mouse Gene with TruHumanization™

## Create the ultimate humanized mouse model with precise gene replacement.

TruHumanization™ technology, exclusively at ingenious targeting laboratory, allows for precise gene replacement of entire mouse genes with human genomic sequences.

There are no longer limitations with leaving out human noncoding regions in the design, leading to mouse models that more accurately represent human biology.

TruHumanization™ technology also allows for the addition of reporters or the creation of conditional alleles, providing researchers with increased control over gene expression.

These models enable more effective studies of human genes and diseases, providing researchers with greater control, flexibility, and relevance in their research endeavors.

## What Researchers Say

> "iTL has generated three knockout and conditional KO mice for my lab. One of them is now published and we would like to thank iTL for the very nice service."
>
> — **Kai Ge, PhD**, NIDDK, National Institutes of Health

## Gene Replacement with TruHumanization™

Traditional approaches to humanizing genes in the mouse all lack one or more elements of gene regulation. In addition to upstream promoters and untranslated regions in mRNA, expression can be affected by:

- Promoters located in introns
- Splicing mechanisms
- The gene's chromosomal location

**Only full gene replacement recapitulates all these features.**

Contact us today to discuss a new gene replacement model.

### Key Benefits:
- There is no longer the limitation of leaving out human noncoding regions in your design
- Create a better model to study your human gene of interest
- ingenious makes it easy to replace entire mouse genes with human
- Enhance your model by adding a reporter or making a conditional allele

## Advantages of Fully Humanized Mouse Models

Let ingenious create the ultimate model for you by fully humanizing your gene of interest.

### TruHumanization™ Capabilities:
- Up to 200kb can be replaced in a single step
- Includes both coding and noncoding sequence
- True gene replacement: the mouse sequence is eliminated and replaced with human genomic sequence
- Humanized gene can include a reporter
- Can be made into a conditional allele for increased control over expression
- Can incorporate known disease-causing mutations

### Research Benefits:
- Fully humanized mouse models lead to more faithful gene regulation and processing
- Potential to perform functional and regulatory studies on multiple transcripts
- Provides a more flexible mouse model to study for years to come
