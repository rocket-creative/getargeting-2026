# F.A.S.T Technology

## Inducible/Reversible F.A.S.T.™ Technology

The F.A.S.T.™ (Flexible Accelerated STOP TetO) technology by ingenious targeting laboratory offers researchers a versatile and powerful tool for generating multi-purpose mouse lines with controllable functionalities, all from a single targeting event.

Demonstrated in Science¹, this technology allows for five or more controllable functionalities from the same locus, simply through mating², streamlining the mouse model generation process.

### Available Options:
- Global gene knockout
- Tissue/time-specific gene rescue
- Ectopic gene expression
- Inducible/reversible gene overexpression
- Inducible/reversible gene knockdown

These options can be applied to your gene of interest using the F.A.S.T.™ cassette, providing flexibility and versatility for your research endeavors. By incorporating this technology, researchers can achieve precise control over gene expression levels and patterns, enhancing the adaptability and efficiency of their experimental designs.

## What Researchers Say

> "The project was very well managed…in fact, using iTL validated my decision to not try and do this in my own lab. It would have been a catastrophe… (My project manager) was very helpful, always getting back to us in time and explaining every step of the project. I would be glad to serve as a reference for iTL and its staff."

Depicted in the schematic below, Tanaka KF et al showed that the F.A.S.T.™ system achieves a spectrum of controllable expression levels from the Mlc1 gene, thereby streamlining the mouse model generation process.

### How F.A.S.T.™ Works

As a knockout first, the Mlc1 gene function was rescued by mating the initial mouse line to a tissue specific Cre line of choice. Alternatively, gene expression can be induced through the F.A.S.T.™ cassette.

- **Ectopic Gene Expression:** A tetracycline transactivator (tTA) line was used to produce an ectopic gene expression model
- **Tissue-Specific Over-Expression:** The tTA line also enabled tissue-specific over-expression models
- **Conditional Knockdown/Knockout:** A tetracycline trans-silencer line was used to generate a tissue-specific conditional knockdown/knockout

**These principles are possible for your gene of interest using the F.A.S.T.™ cassette, making your research more flexible.**
