# Rat Models

## Get your custom rat model in less time & with more certainty.

Our process ensures faster germline transmission modifications. We offer custom rat models, including conventional knockouts, conditional knockouts, reporter knockins, and humanized cDNA knockins, tailored to your research needs.

Available in various rat strains like Sprague Dawley, Long Evans, Wistar, and Lewis, our models provide reliable and efficient solutions for your scientific questions.

## What Researchers Say

> "We have worked with inGenious Targeting Laboratory, Inc. on a variety of conventional, conditional and knockin projects, and we are very impressed with how flexible their service was to our needs and expectations. We look forward to our continued success in generating different mouse models with iTL."

## What Types of Rat Models Are Possible?

The types of custom rat models that we can make for you include:

### Knockout Models
- **Conventional Knockout** - Standard gene deletion
- **Knockout/Reporter Knockin** - Gene deletion with reporter integration
- **Cre-conditional Knockout** - Conditional knockout with LoxP sites

### Knockin Models
- **Point Mutation Knockin** - Precise base pair changes
- **Reporter Gene Knockin** - Integration of reporter genes
- **Humanized cDNA Knockin** - Human gene sequences inserted

## Rat Strains Available

Gene targeting in diverse rat strains, including:

- **Sprague Dawley** (outbred)
- **Long Evans** (outbred)
- **Wistar** (outbred)
- **Lewis** (inbred)

## Why Rat Models?

Rats have been used to model human disease for over a century within a broad range of science fields including neurobiology, cardiology, immunology and toxicology.

Their size and physiological similarity to humans make them an ideal choice for many labs. For example, surgical manipulations can be performed on rats that are difficult or impossible with smaller rodents, and fewer animals are required to generate sufficient material for experiments.
