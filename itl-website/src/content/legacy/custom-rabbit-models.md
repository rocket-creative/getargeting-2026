# Rabbit Models

## Genetically engineered rabbit models for studying human disease

Advance your research by creating a custom genetically engineered rabbit model with ingenious targeting laboratory. Rabbits offer significant advantages due to their anatomical and physiological similarities to humans, making them ideal for pulmonary, cardiovascular, and metabolic studies.

Our technology enables the creation of precise knockout, point mutation, and small tag knockin models. Ingenious targeting laboratory provides a streamlined process, from design to delivery, ensuring efficient and accurate rabbit model development to drive progress in drug discovery and disease research.

## What Researchers Say

> "We recently generated a conditional knockout mouse model using iTL (inGenious Targeting Laboratory). We chose iTL based on time, cost, recommendation and location. We were pleased with the technical help we received in identifying the scope of the project. As well, information and services provided by the project manager were timely and extremely helpful and we were very impressed with the customer service. We were promptly updated throughout the project and upon completion, information was provided to help with genotyping and continuation of the project. We are very happy with the prompt services provided by iTL and would happily recommend them to our colleagues."

## Custom Rabbit Model Targeting Options

- **Conventional KO** - Standard gene knockout
- **Point mutation KI** - Precise base pair changes
- **Small tag KI** - Integration of small protein tags

## Why Rabbit Models?

Rabbits have a unique advantage as animal models for biomedical research. Adult rabbits are closer in weight and size to humans than are smaller animals, allowing technology and equipment developed for humans to be easily tested.

Because of the anatomical, physiological, genetic and biochemical similarities between the rabbit and the human, this species is preferentially used in pulmonary, cardiovascular and metabolic studies.

Ingenious has partnered with leading researchers to develop custom rabbit models. With this, ingenious rabbit models strive to address the needs of drug discovery and drive progress in disease research.

## The Power of Rabbit Disease Models: Rabbit Facts

Rabbits have a gestation period of 30-31 days, large litter sizes of 4-12 kits per litter, and can be housed conveniently in an indoor facility. Compared to mice, rabbits are phylogenetically closer to humans.

## Preferential for the Following Studies

- Airway obstructive disease
- Embolic stroke
- Arteriosclerosis
- Cholera
- Cystic fibrosis
- Neoplasia
- Diabetes
- Acute respiratory distress syndrome
- Malignant lymphoma
- Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome
- Hypercalcemia of malignancy

A major bottleneck in researching human disease and developing new drugs is the lack of large animal models that more accurately simulate human disease in the pre-clinical setting. For example, although the study of the cardiovascular system has benefited significantly from the use of mouse models, small rodents do not always reflect human cardiovascular physiology.

To generate more useful animal models for better mimicking the human system, ingenious offers rabbit models for disease exploration. Rabbits are good models for disease research because their systems are similar to those of humans.

## How Can I Get Started?

The process starts with evaluating your target gene for knockout or knockin design feasibility, and then carrying out the rabbit model production process. From project initiation to founder or germline transmission rabbits, the timeline is estimated to be about 12 months.
