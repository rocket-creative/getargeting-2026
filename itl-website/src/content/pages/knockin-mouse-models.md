# Knockin Mouse Models

Since 1998, Ingenious Targeting Laboratory has completed over 2,500 custom gene targeting projects for researchers at universities, pharmaceutical companies, and research institutions worldwide. Our mouse models have supported research published in more than 800 peer reviewed articles, including in Science, Nature, and Cell.

Knockin mouse models enable precise genetic modifications at endogenous loci. Unlike knockout models that eliminate gene function, knockin models modify genes in specific ways: introducing point mutations that mimic human disease alleles, inserting reporter genes to visualize expression patterns, or adding epitope tags to track protein localization. Because modifications occur at the native locus, knockin alleles maintain endogenous regulatory control over expression timing, tissue distribution, and transcript processing.

From single nucleotide changes to complete gene replacements, ITL designs and delivers knockin mice tailored to your experimental requirements.

## Knockin Approaches

### Point Mutation Knockin

Point mutation knockin models introduce specific nucleotide changes into the endogenous gene. This approach is essential for modeling human disease alleles, studying structure function relationships, and creating drug resistant or drug sensitized variants for pharmacological studies.

Point mutations can be introduced as constitutive changes present from conception, or as conditional alleles that convert from wildtype to mutant sequence upon Cre mediated recombination.

### Reporter Knockin

Reporter knockin models insert visualization markers at endogenous loci. Common reporters include fluorescent proteins (GFP, tdTomato, mCherry), enzymatic reporters (LacZ, alkaline phosphatase), and bioluminescent reporters (luciferase). Reporter expression is driven by the endogenous promoter, providing accurate readout of native gene expression patterns.

Reporter knockins enable lineage tracing, cell sorting of expressing populations, and real time monitoring of gene expression in living animals.

### Tag Knockin

Tag knockin models add epitope tags to endogenous proteins for biochemical detection, purification, or localization studies. Common tags include FLAG, HA, V5, and Myc. Tags can be positioned at the N terminus, C terminus, or internal locations depending on protein structure and experimental requirements.

Because tagged proteins are expressed at physiological levels under native regulatory control, tag knockin models avoid overexpression artifacts common with transgenic approaches.

### cDNA Knockin

cDNA knockin models replace the endogenous coding sequence with an alternative cDNA. Applications include humanization (replacing mouse gene with human ortholog), isoform specific expression, and introduction of modified or optimized coding sequences.

cDNA knockins maintain endogenous regulatory elements while providing complete control over the expressed protein sequence.

### Conditional Knockin

Conditional knockin models express modified alleles only after Cre mediated activation. A stop cassette flanked by LoxP sites prevents expression until Cre excision. This approach enables tissue specific or temporally controlled expression of mutant alleles, reporters, or other modifications.

Conditional knockins are particularly valuable for studying oncogenic mutations that would be lethal if expressed globally from conception.

## Technical Approach

### Allele Design

Knockin allele design requires careful consideration of the modification site, surrounding sequence context, and potential effects on gene expression. Our scientific team analyzes:

- Optimal insertion site for reporters and tags
- Codon context for point mutations
- Splice site preservation
- Regulatory element maintenance

## When to Use Knockin Models

Knockin Approach

Alternative

Model human disease mutation

Point mutation knockin

Transgenic (but loses native regulation)

Visualize gene expression

Reporter knockin

Transgenic reporter (but random integration)

Track protein localization

Tag knockin

## Frequently Asked Questions

**What is the difference between a knockin and a transgenic mouse?**

A knockin mouse has a precise modification at a specific genomic location, typically the endogenous gene locus. Expression is controlled by native regulatory elements. A transgenic mouse carries randomly integrated DNA that inserts at unpredictable locations, often in multiple copies. Knockins provide physiological expression levels; transgenics often overexpress.

**What reporter options are available for knockin models?**

Common reporters include fluorescent proteins (GFP, EGFP, tdTomato, mCherry), enzymatic reporters (LacZ/beta-galactosidase), and bioluminescent reporters (luciferase). Reporter selection depends on your detection method, tissue of interest, and whether you need to combine with other fluorescent tools.

**How do I choose between N-terminal and C-terminal tag placement?**

Tag placement depends on protein structure and function. N-terminal tags can interfere with signal peptides or membrane targeting. C-terminal tags avoid signal sequence issues but may affect protein interactions at the terminus. Contact us to discuss tag positioning.

**How long does it take to generate a knockin mouse model?**

Knockin projects typically require 6-10 months depending on complexity. Point mutations and small tags are faster. Large insertions require more time. Timelines include gene analysis, target design determination, material generation, injection, and breeding of F0s to obtain germline transmission mice.
