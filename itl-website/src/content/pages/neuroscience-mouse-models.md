# Neuroscience Mouse Models

Since 1998, Ingenious Targeting Laboratory has supported neuroscience researchers with custom mouse models contributing to peer reviewed publications in Nature Neuroscience, Neuron, Cell, Journal of Neuroscience, and leading neuroscience journals worldwide. Our neuroscience mouse models have advanced understanding of neural development, synaptic function, behavior, and neurological disease.

Neuroscience mouse models enable researchers to investigate the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying brain function and dysfunction. From cell type specific knockouts that dissect neural circuit function to disease mutation knockins that model neurological conditions, the right model design is critical for understanding the nervous system and developing treatments for neurological disorders.

Conditional approaches are particularly important in neuroscience, where the same gene often has distinct functions in different neuronal populations, glial cells, and developmental stages. Ingenious Targeting Laboratory designs and generates custom neuroscience models tailored to your specific research questions.

### Inducible Neural Cre Lines

## Model Types for Neuroscience

### Conditional Knockout

Essential for neuroscience due to:

- Many neural genes cause embryonic lethality when deleted globally
- Cell type specificity reveals circuit level gene function
- Temporal control distinguishes developmental from adult roles
- Brain region specificity possible with appropriate Cre drivers

(/conditional-knockout-mouse-models)

### Point Mutation Knockin

Model disease associated variants at physiological levels:

- Familial disease mutations (AD, PD, HD)
- GWAS identified risk variants
- Phosphorylation site mutations for signaling studies

(/point-mutation-mice)

### Reporter Knockin

Visualize gene expression and cell populations:

- Cell type markers for identification and sorting
- Activity reporters for functional imaging
- Lineage tracing of neural progenitors

(/reporter-knockin)

## Technical Considerations

### Pre Germline Characterization

ES cell based targeting enables verification of neuroscience alleles before mouse generation:

- Confirm correct allele structure
- Verify disease mutation sequences
- Test reporter expression where applicable
- Ensure loxP sites do not disrupt gene function

### Strain Background

Strain background affects neural and behavioral phenotypes:

- C57BL/6:** Most common, good learning performance, some anxiety
- 129 strains:** Variable behavioral phenotypes, less commonly used
- BALB/c:** Distinct behavioral profile, higher anxiety
- FVB:** Good for transgenics but retinal degeneration (rd1)

C57BL/6 is generally preferred for neuroscience to enable comparison with published literature and behavioral databases.

### Behavioral Phenotyping Considerations

- Age matching for behavioral cohorts
- Sex as biological variable
- Circadian timing of testing
- Environmental standardization
- Appropriate statistical power

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Why are conditional knockouts essential for neuroscience research?**

Many neural genes are essential for embryonic development and cause lethality when deleted globally. Conditional knockouts allow gene deletion in specific cell types (neurons, astrocytes, microglia) or brain regions, enabling study of gene function in adult animals without developmental defects.

**What Cre driver lines are available for neuroscience research?**

Common neural Cre drivers include Nestin-Cre (neural progenitors), Synapsin-Cre (neurons), GFAP-Cre (astrocytes), and CX3CR1-Cre (microglia). Inducible CreERT2 systems enable temporal control. Cre driver selection depends on your target cell type and research question.

**Can I model neurodegenerative diseases with mouse models?**

Yes. Point mutation knockins can introduce human disease mutations (e.g., APP, tau, α-synuclein mutations for AD, PD). Conditional systems enable tissue-specific expression of disease proteins. Reporter knockins enable visualization of disease protein aggregation and spread.

**What strain background is best for behavioral neuroscience studies?**

C57BL/6 is most commonly used for behavioral studies due to good learning performance, extensive characterization, and compatibility with published behavioral databases. BALB/c and 129 strains have distinct behavioral profiles that may be appropriate for specific research questions.

**How do I ensure reproducible behavioral phenotypes?**

Standardize age, sex, circadian timing, and environmental conditions. Use littermate controls from heterozygous crosses. Ensure adequate statistical power. Consider that genetic background modifiers can affect behavioral outcomes, so maintaining defined backgrounds is important.
