# Tissue Specific Knockout

Since 1998, Ingenious Targeting Laboratory has completed over 2,500 mouse models, including conditional knockouts that enable tissue specific gene deletion. Our tissue specific knockout models have supported research published in over 800 peer reviewed publications, including articles in Science, Nature, and Cell.

Tissue specific knockout restricts gene deletion to defined cell types or organs while preserving gene function elsewhere in the organism. By crossing a floxed (conditional) allele to a tissue specific Cre driver line, gene deletion occurs only in cells where Cre recombinase is expressed. This approach enables study of genes that cause embryonic lethality when deleted globally, isolation of cell autonomous gene functions, and dissection of tissue specific phenotypes without confounding systemic effects.

A single floxed allele can be crossed to dozens of different Cre driver lines, enabling tissue specific deletion across virtually every organ system from one initial mouse line.

## How Tissue Specific Knockout Works

### The Two Component System

Tissue specific knockout requires two genetic components:

**Floxed (Conditional) Allele:** The target gene contains loxP sites flanking critical exons. The floxed allele functions normally in the absence of Cre recombinase.

**Cre Driver Line:** A transgenic or knockin line expressing Cre recombinase under a tissue specific promoter. Cre is expressed only in defined cell types.

When these lines are crossed, offspring carrying both alleles undergo gene deletion specifically in Cre expressing cells. Cells without Cre retain normal gene function.

### Deletion Pattern Determination

The tissue specificity of gene deletion is determined entirely by the Cre driver:

- Promoter activity:** Which cells express the Cre transgene
- Developmental timing:** When Cre expression begins
- Expression level:** Efficiency of recombination
- Mosaicism:** Whether all target cells undergo deletion

Choosing the right Cre driver is critical for experimental success.

## Choosing the Right Cre Driver

### Key Selection Criteria

Selecting the optimal Cre driver requires consideration of multiple factors:

- Specificity:** Does Cre expression match your target population?
- Efficiency:** What percentage of target cells undergo recombination?
- Timing:** When does deletion occur relative to your experimental question?
- Ectopic expression:** Does the Cre driver have off-target expression?
- Cre toxicity:** High Cre levels can cause cellular effects independent of target gene deletion

### Validation Approaches

Before experimental studies, validate Cre activity with reporter lines:

- Cross Cre driver to Rosa26 reporter (tdTomato, lacZ)
- Confirm expected tissue distribution of reporter expression
- Assess recombination efficiency in target population
- Check for unexpected ectopic expression

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Germline recombination:** Some Cre drivers cause deletion in germline, converting conditional to global knockout
- Leaky expression:** Low level Cre in non-target tissues
- Mosaic deletion:** Incomplete recombination in target population
- Developmental vs adult expression:** Embryonic Cre deletes during development; may not reflect adult gene function

(/cre-line-selection-guide)

## Experimental Design

### Breeding Strategy

Standard breeding scheme for tissue specific knockout:

- Cross floxed/floxed mice to Cre positive mice
- F1 offspring: 50% floxed/+ Cre positive (tissue specific heterozygous knockout)
- Intercross F1 to generate floxed/floxed Cre positive (tissue specific homozygous knockout)
- Use floxed/floxed Cre negative littermates as controls

### Control Considerations

Appropriate controls for tissue specific knockout experiments:

- Cre negative littermates:** Floxed allele without Cre (preferred control)
- Cre only controls:** Cre driver without floxed allele (controls for Cre expression effects)
- Wildtype:** No modifications (baseline comparison)

### Confirming Tissue Specific Deletion

Verify deletion in experimental animals:

- PCR genotyping for recombined allele in target tissue
- Western blot or immunohistochemistry for protein loss in target tissue
- qPCR for transcript reduction
- Confirm preservation of expression in non target tissues

## Applications

### Essential Genes

Tissue specific knockout enables study of genes that cause embryonic lethality when deleted globally. By restricting deletion to non-essential tissues or adult stages, researchers can study gene function without developmental lethality.

### Cell Autonomous Function

Tissue specific deletion distinguishes cell autonomous from non cell autonomous gene function. Does the phenotype arise from gene loss in the target tissue, or from secondary effects elsewhere?

### Target Validation

Tissue specific knockout reveals where target inhibition would have therapeutic effects and where it might cause toxicity, supporting drug development decisions.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**How do tissue-specific knockouts work?**

Tissue-specific knockouts combine floxed alleles (loxP sites flanking critical exons) with Cre driver lines that express Cre recombinase in specific cell types or tissues. When the floxed mouse is crossed to a tissue-specific Cre driver, gene deletion occurs only in Cre-expressing tissues while gene function is preserved elsewhere. This enables study of tissue-autonomous gene function.

**What Cre drivers are commonly used for tissue-specific knockouts?**

Common Cre drivers include Albumin-Cre (hepatocytes), Nestin-Cre (neural progenitors), LysM-Cre (myeloid cells), CD4-Cre (T cells), Adiponectin-Cre (adipocytes), Myh6-Cre (cardiomyocytes), and many others. Selection depends on your target tissue and research question. Reporter crosses verify expected tissue distribution before experimental use.

**Can I use the same floxed mouse with different Cre drivers?**

Yes. This is a major advantage of conditional knockout systems. A single floxed allele can be crossed to any Cre driver line to achieve tissue-specific knockout in different organs. One floxed mouse project can support studies across multiple tissues (liver, brain, immune cells, etc) simply by crossing to different Cre drivers.

**What controls are needed for tissue-specific knockout experiments?**

Required controls include: floxed mice without Cre (flox/flox; +/+) as baseline controls, Cre-only controls (+/+; Cre/+) to assess Cre effects, and tissue-specific knockout experimental animals (flox/flox; Cre/+). Comparing these groups ensures that phenotypes result from gene deletion in the target tissue rather than Cre expression or background effects.

**How do I verify tissue-specific deletion has occurred?**

Genomic PCR using primers flanking the loxP sites reveals deletion: wildtype and floxed alleles produce larger bands; recombined (deleted) allele produces a smaller band. Reporter crosses (Rosa26-tdTomato) visualize recombination pattern and confirm deletion in expected tissues. Functional assays (Western blot, immunohistochemistry) confirm loss of protein in target tissue.
