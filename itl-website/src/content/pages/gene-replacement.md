# Gene Replacement Mouse Models

Since 1998, Ingenious Targeting Laboratory has generated gene replacement humanized models that substitute mouse genes with their human orthologs. This approach enables preclinical testing of human specific therapeutics and study of human disease mechanisms in physiologically relevant contexts.

Gene replacement humanization maintains expression under endogenous regulatory control, preserving tissue specific and temporal expression patterns while providing human target sequences for drug development and mechanistic research.

## What Is Gene Replacement Humanization

Gene replacement humanization substitutes a mouse gene with its human ortholog. Unlike simple cDNA insertion, comprehensive gene replacement can include the entire coding sequence, regulatory elements, and alternative splice variants to faithfully recapitulate human gene expression and function.

### Complete vs Partial Replacement

Complete gene replacement substitutes the entire mouse gene including promoter, coding exons, introns, and regulatory elements with the corresponding human sequences. This approach is optimal when preserving human specific regulation is essential.

Partial replacement substitutes only the coding sequence while retaining mouse regulatory elements. This approach is often sufficient when the primary goal is expressing human protein for therapeutic target validation.

### cDNA vs Genomic Replacement

cDNA replacement inserts the human coding sequence without introns. This approach generates a single protein isoform and is appropriate when alternative splicing is not critical to your research question.

Genomic replacement preserves intron-exon structure, enabling expression of alternatively spliced isoforms and maintaining potential intronic regulatory elements. This approach more faithfully recapitulates human gene function.

## Applications of Gene Replacement Models

### Therapeutic Antibody Development

Many therapeutic antibodies show species specificity, binding human but not mouse orthologs. Gene replacement humanization of the target creates mice suitable for preclinical efficacy testing of human specific antibodies.

Common applications include humanization of surface receptors, secreted proteins, and checkpoint molecules for antibody drug development programs.

### Small Molecule Target Validation

When small molecules show differential activity against human versus mouse targets, gene replacement models enable testing in a physiological context with the human target.

This is particularly relevant for targets where the binding site differs between species or where metabolic pathways affect drug activity differently in humans and mice.

### Disease Mechanism Studies

Human disease causing mutations can be studied in the context of the complete human gene. This is especially valuable for diseases where mouse orthologs do not fully recapitulate human disease pathology.

### Gene Therapy Development

Gene therapy vectors designed for human sequences require humanized models for preclinical testing. Gene replacement creates the appropriate target for testing vector delivery, expression, and therapeutic effect.

## Gene Replacement Targeting Strategy

### Allele Design Considerations

Gene replacement allele design must account for sequence differences between mouse and human genes, including gene length, exon number, regulatory element locations, and protein domains.

Ingenious Targeting Laboratory's scientific team evaluates each project to determine replacement boundaries and targeting strategy based on your specific research goals.

### Large Fragment Targeting

When the human gene is larger than can be accommodated in standard targeting vectors, Ingenious Targeting Laboratory uses bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) based approaches or sequential targeting strategies to achieve complete replacement.

## Common Gene Replacement Applications

### Immune Checkpoint Humanization

PD1, PDL1, CTLA4, LAG3, TIM3, and other checkpoint molecules are frequently humanized to enable testing of checkpoint inhibitor antibodies in immunocompetent mice.

### Receptor Humanization

G protein coupled receptors, cytokine receptors, growth factor receptors, and other therapeutic target receptors are humanized to enable drug development in relevant preclinical models.

### Enzyme Humanization

Metabolic enzymes, particularly those relevant to drug metabolism or inherited metabolic disease, are humanized to improve translation from preclinical to clinical findings.

## What Researchers Say

*“I’ve been working with iTL over the past 5 years in the production of 3 different genetically altered mice. Not only did iTL help in the design of the mice, but the entire process was transparent with the opportunity at any time along the way to discuss my questions or concerns with scientists who had significant insight into the process. The mice were delivered on time, as billed!”*

## Frequently Asked Questions

**When is gene replacement used instead of simple overexpression?**

Gene replacement is used when you need to study human gene function in mouse context (for therapeutic testing), when you need endogenous regulation and expression patterns, or when overexpression would cause artifacts. Replacement maintains native gene regulation, expression levels, and chromosomal context, unlike random transgene integration.

**Can gene replacement be combined with other modifications?**

Yes. Gene replacement can be combined with conditional approaches, point mutations, or other genetic modifications. For example, humanized checkpoint models can be combined with conditional knockout of other genes, or humanized receptors can be combined with reporter knockins for expression tracking.
