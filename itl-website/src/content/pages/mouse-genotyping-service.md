# Mouse Genotyping Services

Since 1998, Ingenious Targeting Laboratory has provided comprehensive genotyping services supporting thousands of mouse model projects. Our genotyping capabilities ensure accurate breeding decisions and experimental design throughout your research program.

Reliable genotyping is essential for maintaining mouse colonies, verifying genetic modifications, and ensuring experimental reproducibility. Ingenious Targeting Laboratory offers multiple genotyping methods tailored to your specific allele design and verification requirements.

## Genotyping Methods

### PCR Based Genotyping

PCR genotyping provides rapid, cost effective verification of targeted alleles:

- Allele Specific PCR**: Detects presence of targeted allele
- Wild Type PCR**: Confirms absence of wild type allele
- Heterozygous/Homozygous Discrimination**: Distinguishes genotype
- Multiplex PCR**: Simultaneous detection of multiple alleles

PCR genotyping is ideal for routine colony maintenance and rapid screening of large numbers of animals.

### Southern Blot Analysis

Southern blot provides definitive verification of complex allele structures:

- Correct Integration**: Confirms targeting at intended locus
- Single Copy Verification**: Ensures no random insertions
- Allele Structure**: Verifies complete allele architecture
- Pre Germline Characterization**: ES cell clone verification

### Quantitative PCR (qPCR)

qPCR enables copy number determination and expression analysis:

- Copy Number Analysis**: Determines transgene copy number
- Expression Level Quantification**: Measures gene expression
- Relative Quantification**: Compares expression between samples
- High Throughput Screening**: Rapid analysis of multiple samples

### Sequencing Based Genotyping

Sequencing provides nucleotide level verification:

- Point Mutation Verification**: Confirms specific nucleotide changes
- Small Insertion/Deletion Detection**: Identifies small indels
- Fusion Junction Verification**: Confirms correct fusion sequences
- Complete Allele Sequencing**: Full sequence verification

Sequencing is essential for verifying point mutations and small genetic modifications.

## Genotyping Applications

### Colony Maintenance

Routine genotyping ensures correct colony composition:

- Breeding Pair Selection**: Verify genotypes before mating
- Offspring Screening**: Identify desired genotypes
- Colony Purity**: Maintain genetic background integrity
- Allele Transmission**: Track allele inheritance

### Experimental Design

Genotyping supports experimental planning:

- Genotype Verification**: Confirm experimental groups
- Control Selection**: Identify appropriate controls
- Cohort Assembly**: Assemble study cohorts with correct genotypes
- Phenotype Correlation**: Link phenotypes to genotypes

### Quality Assurance

Genotyping provides quality control:

- Allele Integrity**: Verify allele structure over generations
- Contamination Detection**: Identify genetic contamination
- Background Verification**: Confirm genetic background
- Archival Verification**: Verify archived samples

## Service Workflow

### Sample Submission

Samples can be submitted in multiple formats:

- Tail Biopsies**: Standard tail snip samples
- Ear Punches**: Alternative tissue samples
- Blood Samples**: For specific applications

## Frequently Asked Questions

**What genotyping methods does ITL use?**

ITL uses multiple genotyping methods including PCR-based genotyping (standard for routine colony screening), Southern blot analysis (for complex alleles or validation), and sequencing (for point mutations or sequence verification). Method selection depends on allele complexity, throughput needs, and validation requirements.

**Can ITL develop custom genotyping assays for new alleles?**

Yes. ITL can design custom genotyping assays for novel alleles, complex multi-component alleles, optimized protocols for improved efficiency or specificity, and multiplex assays for simultaneous detection of multiple alleles. Custom assay development includes protocol optimization and validation.

**What information is provided with genotyping results?**

Genotyping results include clear genotype calls (heterozygous, homozygous, or wild-type), quality metrics with confidence scores, gel images for visual confirmation when applicable, and interpretation guidance to help with result interpretation. Results are provided in formats suitable for colony management records.

**Do you provide high-throughput genotyping for large colonies?**

Yes. ITL provides high-throughput genotyping services optimized for rapid screening of large colonies. Optimized protocols reduce reagent costs while maintaining reliability and specificity. We work with you to determine the most efficient approach for your colony size and genotyping frequency needs.
