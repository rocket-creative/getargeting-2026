# Knockout Mouse Models

Since 1998, Ingenious Targeting Laboratory has completed over 2,500 custom gene targeting projects for researchers at universities, pharmaceutical companies, and research institutions worldwide. Our knockout mouse models have supported research published in more than 800 peer reviewed articles, including in Science, Nature, Cell.

Knockout mouse models enable loss of function studies by inactivating specific genes. Whether you need complete gene deletion throughout the organism or controlled inactivation in specific tissues at defined times, ITL designs and delivers knockout mice tailored to your experimental requirements. From conventional knockouts for straightforward gene deletion to sophisticated conditional systems using Cre lox and other recombinase technologies, the right knockout strategy is critical for your research success.

## Knockout Approaches

### Conventional Knockout

Conventional knockout models provide global gene inactivation from the earliest stages of development. The target gene is disrupted throughout all tissues for the lifetime of the animal. This approach is appropriate when studying genes that are not essential for embryonic development and when whole organism effects are the primary research interest.

Conventional knockouts offer a straightforward path to loss of function phenotypes with shorter project timelines and lower complexity than conditional approaches.

### Conditional Knockout

Conditional knockout models use the Cre lox system to control where and when gene inactivation occurs. LoxP sites flanking critical exons remain silent until the allele is exposed to Cre recombinase, at which point the target sequence is excised and gene function is lost.

This approach is essential when global knockout causes embryonic lethality, when tissue specific gene function is the research focus, or when temporal control over gene deletion is required. Conditional knockouts provide maximum experimental flexibility from a single allele design.

### Tissue Specific Knockout

Tissue specific knockouts combine conditional (floxed) alleles with Cre driver lines that express Cre recombinase in defined cell populations. Gene inactivation is restricted to tissues where Cre is active, while gene function is preserved in all other cells.

Common applications include studying gene function in specific organs, investigating cell autonomous versus non cell autonomous effects, and avoiding confounding systemic phenotypes that can mask the biology of interest.

### Inducible Knockout

Inducible knockout models add temporal control to conditional systems. Tamoxifen inducible CreERT2 or doxycycline regulated systems allow researchers to trigger gene deletion at specific developmental stages or in adult animals.

This approach enables studies of gene function after normal development, investigation of acute versus chronic loss of function phenotypes, and modeling of disease onset in mature animals.

## Technical Approach

### Allele Design

Ingenious Targeting Laboratory designs knockout alleles based on your specific experimental requirements. Critical exons are selected for loss of function after deletion. For conditional alleles, LoxP sites are positioned to preserve normal gene expression in the absence of Cre while supporting null phenotypes after excision.

## Knockout Model Selection Strategy

### When to Choose Conventional Knockout

Conventional knockout models are optimal when complete gene deletion throughout the organism is desired and tissue specific or temporal control is not required. These models are faster to generate, typically more cost effective, and provide definitive loss of function phenotypes.

Conventional knockouts are ideal for studying genes with non essential functions, genes where global deletion does not cause embryonic lethality, and research applications where tissue specific effects are not a concern.

### When to Choose Conditional Knockout

Conditional knockout models using the Cre lox system provide spatial and temporal control over gene deletion. These models are essential when global gene deletion causes embryonic lethality, when tissue specific gene function needs to be studied, or when temporal control of gene inactivation is required.

Conditional knockouts enable researchers to study gene function in specific tissues at defined developmental stages or in response to experimental treatments, providing flexibility that conventional knockouts cannot offer.

### Project Planning Considerations

When planning a knockout project, consider your long term research goals. If multiple research applications are anticipated, a conditional knockout provides maximum flexibility. If the research question is focused and well defined, a conventional knockout may be more efficient.

Ingenious Targeting Laboratory's scientific consultants work with researchers to select the optimal knockout strategy based on research goals, timeline, and budget considerations.

## Advanced Knockout Strategies

### Knockout First Allele System

The knockout first allele system provides maximum flexibility by generating a single targeting event that can produce multiple derivative alleles. This approach is cost effective when multiple research applications are anticipated from a single model.

Knockout first alleles can be converted to conditional knockouts, reporter knockins, or other configurations through breeding with appropriate recombinase lines, providing researchers with multiple options from a single initial investment.

### Tissue Specific Knockout Considerations

When planning tissue specific knockouts, careful selection of Cre driver lines is essential. The Cre line must express in your target tissue but not in tissues where gene deletion would cause confounding effects or embryonic lethality.

## Knockout Project Planning

Effective knockout project planning requires consideration of your long term research goals, downstream applications, and budget constraints. Our team works with researchers to select the optimal knockout strategy that balances flexibility, timeline, and cost.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**What is the difference between a conventional knockout and a conditional knockout?**

A conventional knockout permanently eliminates gene function in all tissues from the earliest stages of development. A conditional knockout uses the Cre-lox system to control where and when gene deletion occurs. Conditional knockouts preserve normal gene function until exposed to Cre recombinase, allowing tissue-specific or temporally controlled gene inactivation.

**How do I know if my gene is essential and requires a conditional knockout approach?**

If homozygous null mutations of your target gene result in embryonic lethality in published studies, a conditional approach is required. If no published data exists, we recommend starting with a conditional allele design, which can function as a conventional knockout when crossed to germline Cre, while preserving the option for tissue-specific studies.

**What is a floxed allele?**

A floxed allele contains LoxP sites flanking a critical exon of your target gene. The gene functions normally until exposed to Cre recombinase, which excises the DNA between LoxP sites. This deletion removes a critical exon(s) and eliminates gene function. Floxed alleles are the foundation of conditional knockout strategies.

**How long does it take to generate a knockout mouse model?**

Conventional knockout projects typically require 6-8 months. Conditional knockout projects can take  8-10 months due to additional complexity in allele design and verification. Timelines include strategy design, materials generation and confirmation, injection, and breeding of F0s to obtain germline transmission mice.

**What deliverables will I receive at the end of a knockout project?**

You will receive a minimum of 2 germline transmission F1 heterozygous mice, comprehensive project verification documentation, and genotyping protocols.
