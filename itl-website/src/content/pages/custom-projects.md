# Custom Mouse Model Projects

Every research question is unique. Ingenious Targeting Laboratory specializes in designing and generating custom mouse models precisely matched to your experimental requirements. Since 1998, we have completed more than 2,500 custom projects, developing expertise across every model type and therapeutic area.

Whether you need a straightforward knockout, a sophisticated conditional allele, a precise point mutation, or a complex humanization, Ingenious Targeting Laboratory's scientific team provides the design expertise and technical capability to deliver study ready animals.

## Our Custom Approach

### Scientific Consultation

Every project begins with detailed scientific consultation. Our team works with you to:

- Understand your research goals and experimental design
- Evaluate targeting strategy options
- Recommend optimal allele configurations
- Anticipate potential challenges
- Design for downstream applications

This collaborative approach ensures your model delivers the experimental capabilities you need.

### Tailored Allele Design

We design each allele specifically for your research application:

**Knockout Alleles** optimized for complete loss of function with appropriate exon selection and reading frame disruption

**Conditional Alleles** designed with loxP site positioning that preserves gene function until Cre mediated deletion

**Knockin Alleles** engineered for precise sequence integration with maintained reading frame and expression

**Humanized Alleles** configured for species appropriate expression of human sequences

## Project Types

### Conventional Knockout Projects

Complete elimination of target gene function from earliest developmental stages. Best when:

- Gene is not required for embryonic survival
- Complete loss of function phenotype is desired
- Research question focuses on essential gene function

### Conditional Knockout Projects

LoxP flanked alleles enabling controlled gene deletion. Best when:

- Global knockout causes embryonic lethality
- Tissue specific gene function needs investigation
- Temporal control of gene deletion is required
- Comparison of multiple Cre drivers is planned

### Knockin Projects

Precise genetic modifications at defined loci including:

- Point Mutations**: Single nucleotide changes modeling disease variants
- cDNA Knockins**: Alternative coding sequence under endogenous control
- Reporter Knockins**: Fluorescent or enzymatic reporters marking gene expression
- Tag Knockins**: Epitope tags enabling protein detection and purification
- Conditional Knockins**: Controllable expression of inserted sequences

### Humanization Projects

Replacement of mouse sequences with human:

- Full Gene Humanization**: Complete gene replacement
- Exon Humanization**: Targeted domain replacement
- Immune Checkpoint Humanization**: PD1, PDL1, CTLA4, LAG3, TIM3
- Receptor Humanization**: Drug target humanization for therapeutic testing

### Complex and Multi Component Projects

Ingenious Targeting Laboratory excels in sophisticated designs including:

- Dual recombinase systems (Cre lox plus Flp FRT, Dre Rox, etc)
- Inducible expression systems (CreERT2, Tet systems)
- Multi gene modifications
- Large insertion projects (BAC transgenics)
- Safe harbor locus targeting (Rosa26, HPRT, H11)
