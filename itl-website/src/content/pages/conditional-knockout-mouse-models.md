# Conditional Knockout Mouse Models

Since 1998, Ingenious Targeting Laboratory has completed over 2,500 mouse model projects, including conditional knockouts, for researchers at universities, pharmaceutical companies, and research institutions worldwide. Our conditional knockout mouse models have supported research published in more than 800 peer reviewed journals, including Science, Nature, and Cell.

Conditional knockout mouse models enable controlled gene inactivation in specific tissues or at defined times. Unlike conventional knockouts where gene function is lost globally from the earliest developmental stages, conditional knockouts use the Cre lox system to restrict gene deletion to cells expressing Cre recombinase. This approach is essential when studying genes that cause embryonic lethality when deleted globally, when tissue specific gene function is the primary research question, or when temporal control over gene inactivation is required.

Floxed mouse models provide maximum experimental flexibility. A single conditional allele can generate tissue specific knockouts across dozens of organ systems simply by crossing to different Cre driver lines, making the initial investment in allele generation applicable to multiple research programs.

## How Conditional Knockout Works

### The Cre Lox System

Conditional knockout relies on the Cre lox recombination system. LoxP sites are 34 base pair DNA sequences recognized by Cre recombinase. When two loxP sites flank a DNA segment in the same orientation, Cre recombinase excises the intervening sequence, leaving a single loxP site.

In a conditional knockout allele, loxP sites flank one or more critical exons of the target gene. The floxed allele functions normally in the absence of Cre. When crossed to a Cre driver line, cells expressing Cre recombinase excise the floxed exons, creating a null allele in those specific cells while gene function is preserved elsewhere.

### Tissue Specific Gene Deletion

Tissue specificity is achieved through Cre driver lines that express Cre recombinase under tissue specific promoters. Hundreds of Cre driver lines are available, targeting virtually every organ system and cell type.

- Albumin Cre:** Hepatocyte specific deletion
- Nestin Cre:** Neural progenitor and CNS deletion
- LysM Cre:** Myeloid cell specific deletion (macrophages, granulocytes)
- CD4 Cre:** T cell specific deletion
- Myh6 Cre:** Cardiomyocyte specific deletion
- Villin Cre:** Intestinal epithelium specific deletion

### Inducible Gene Deletion

Temporal control is achieved using inducible Cre systems. The most common approach uses CreERT2, a fusion of Cre recombinase with a modified estrogen receptor that is inactive until tamoxifen administration. This allows researchers to trigger gene deletion at any developmental stage or in adult animals.

Inducible systems enable studies of gene function after normal development is complete, investigation of acute versus chronic phenotypes, and modeling of disease onset in mature animals.

## Allele Design and Configuration

### Critical Exon Selection

Successful conditional knockout requires careful selection of exons to flank with loxP sites. The targeted exon or exons must be essential for gene function, such that their deletion creates a true null allele. Considerations include:

- Exons present in all transcript variants
- Exons encoding essential functional domains
- Exon deletion that causes frameshift in downstream sequence
- Avoidance of alternative splicing that could bypass the deletion

Our scientific team analyzes gene structure and transcript architecture to identify optimal exon targets for each project.

### Conditional Knockout with Reporter

Adding a reporter gene to your conditional knockout model enables visualization of when and where gene inactivation occurs, providing confirmation at the single cell level that recombination has successfully knocked out the target gene.

**Reporter Strategies**: Different approaches for incorporating reporters are available depending on your gene structure:

- Inverted Reporter Strategy**: Reporter placed in opposite orientation, activated when Cre inverts the region and deletes the target exon
- Post Exon Reporter**: Reporter placed after the last exon, activated after Cre mediated deletion
- Dual Reporter Systems**: One reporter expressed with the gene, a different reporter expressed after knockout

**TruView Conditional Knockout™**: Ingenious Targeting Laboratory's proprietary TruView technology provides strong reporter expression after knockout and can be used with genes of almost any size. This approach allows visualization of recombined cells, regardless of target gene expression levels, all from one target gene locus.

**Benefits**: Reporter-enabled conditional knockouts satisfy two experimental requirements simultaneously: demonstration of successful knockout and labeling of affected cells and tissues. This cell specific labeling provides confidence that observed phenotypes result from gene deletion in the intended cell population.

### Derivative Allele System

A standard stop cassette configuration enables generation of four derivative alleles from a single targeted mouse line:

- Knockout First:** Original targeted allele with full cassette. Gene is disrupted by stop cassette insertion, functioning as a null allele. 
- Conditional Ready:** Flp excision removes the cassette while leaving loxP sites flanking the critical exon. Gene function is fully restored. This is the floxed allele used for conditional knockout experiments.
- Conditional Null:** Cre excision removes the critical exon, creating the tissue specific or temporally controlled null allele.

This derivative system allows a single project to support reporter studies (if included in stop cassette), conventional knockout controls, and conditional knockout experiments.

## When to Use Conditional Knockout

### Essential Genes

Many genes are essential for embryonic development. Global knockout of these genes results in embryonic lethality, preventing study of gene function in adult tissues. Conditional knockout allows bypass of developmental requirements by restricting gene deletion to specific tissues or to adult stages after development is complete.

### Pleiotropic Genes

Genes with functions in multiple organ systems can produce complex phenotypes when deleted globally. Tissue specific conditional knockout isolates gene function in individual tissues, clarifying which phenotypes are cell autonomous versus secondary to dysfunction elsewhere.

### Cell Type Specific Questions

When the research question focuses on gene function in a specific cell type, conditional knockout provides direct answers without confounding effects from other tissues. This is particularly valuable in immunology, neuroscience, and cancer research where cell type specific gene function drives disease biology.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**What is the difference between a floxed mouse and a conditional knockout?**

A floxed mouse carries loxP sites flanking a critical exon but retains normal gene function. The gene is only inactivated when the floxed mouse is crossed to a Cre driver line. The resulting offspring with both the floxed allele and Cre expression are the actual conditional knockouts, where gene deletion occurs in Cre-expressing tissues.

**Can I use the same floxed mouse line with different Cre drivers?**

Yes. This is a major advantage of conditional knockout models. A single floxed allele can be crossed to any Cre driver line to achieve tissue-specific knockout in different organs. One floxed mouse project can support studies in liver (Albumin-Cre), brain (Nestin-Cre), immune cells (LysM-Cre), and many other tissues.

**How do I choose which exon to flox?**

The critical exon must be essential for gene function. Ideal targets are exons present in all transcript variants, exons encoding functional domains, and exons whose deletion causes frameshift in downstream sequence. Our scientific team analyzes gene structure and transcript architecture to identify optimal targets for each project.

**How long does a conditional knockout project take?**

Custom conditional knockout projects typically require 6-10 months. This accounts for more complex allele designs and verification of loxP site positioning in germline transmission mice. The investment provides greater experimental flexibility through tissue-specific and temporal control.
