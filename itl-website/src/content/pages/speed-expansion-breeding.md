# Speed Expansion Breeding

Ingenious Targeting Laboratory's speed expansion breeding services generate experimental cohorts rapidly through optimized breeding strategies and large scale production capabilities. Since 1998, we have supported researchers with rapid cohort generation for time sensitive studies and large scale experiments.

Speed expansion breeding uses strategic breeding pair management, parallel breeding schemes, and optimized husbandry to accelerate cohort generation while maintaining genetic integrity and health status. This service is ideal when experimental timelines require rapid animal production.

## Speed Expansion Strategies

### Parallel Breeding

Multiple breeding pairs in parallel:

- Multiple Pairs**: Simultaneous breeding from multiple pairs
- Staggered Starts**: Overlapping breeding cycles
- Continuous Production**: Maintained production flow
- Scale**: Large numbers of breeding pairs

### Optimized Breeding Schemes

Breeding strategies designed for speed:

- Heterozygote Intercrosses**: Generate homozygotes efficiently
- Backcross Optimization**: Minimize generations needed
- Age Optimization**: Breed at optimal ages
- Pair Rotation**: Maintain high production rates

### Large Scale Production

Infrastructure for large cohorts:

- High Capacity Housing**: Large numbers of animals
- Efficient Genotyping**: Rapid screening
- Coordinated Breeding**: Synchronized production
- Quality Control**: Maintain genetic integrity

## Applications

### Time Sensitive Studies

When experiments require rapid cohort generation:

- Grant Deadlines**: Meet funding timelines
- Publication Deadlines**: Accelerate research
- Therapeutic Development**: Drug testing timelines
- Collaborative Studies**: Multi site coordination

### Large Scale Experiments

For studies requiring large cohorts:

- High Throughput Screening**: Large animal numbers
- Multi Arm Studies**: Multiple experimental groups
- Dose Response Studies**: Multiple dose groups
- Longitudinal Studies**: Large baseline cohorts

## Service Features

### Timeline Optimization

Strategies to minimize time:

- Early Pairing**: Begin breeding immediately
- Overlapping Cycles**: Continuous production
- Efficient Genotyping**: Rapid screening
- Coordinated Delivery**: Synchronized cohorts

### Quality Assurance

Maintain quality during expansion:

- Genetic Verification**: Confirm genotypes
- Health Monitoring**: Maintain SPF status
- Age Matching**: Synchronized ages
- Sex Balancing**: Appropriate ratios

## Frequently Asked Questions

**How does speed expansion breeding accelerate cohort generation?**

Speed expansion breeding uses parallel breeding (multiple breeding pairs simultaneously), optimized breeding schemes (heterozygote intercrosses for efficient homozygote generation), large-scale production infrastructure, and coordinated genotyping to accelerate timeline from founders to experimental cohorts while maintaining genetic integrity.

**Can speed expansion breeding be used for complex genotypes?**

Yes. Speed expansion breeding can accommodate complex genotypes including multiple alleles, conditional systems requiring Cre crosses, and multi-component models. Breeding strategies are optimized based on genotype complexity, genetic linkage considerations, and experimental requirements.

**What quality controls are maintained during speed expansion breeding?**

Quality controls include accurate genotyping to maintain genetic integrity, health monitoring to ensure pathogen-free status, pedigree documentation for breeding records, and genetic background verification when applicable. Speed expansion maintains the same quality standards as standard breeding services.

**What is included in speed expansion breeding service deliverables?**

Speed expansion breeding deliverables include experimental cohorts at specified ages and genotypes, genotyping documentation confirming genotype distribution, health certificates, and breeding records. Cohorts are delivered study-ready for immediate experimental use.
