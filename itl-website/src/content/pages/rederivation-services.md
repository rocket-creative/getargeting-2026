# Rederivation Services

Ingenious Targeting Laboratory provides mouse rederivation services to reestablish specific pathogen free (SPF) health status for valuable mouse lines. Since 1998, we have successfully rederived hundreds of mouse lines, enabling transfer to SPF facilities and restoration of colony health.

Rederivation eliminates pathogens through embryo transfer or cesarean section, producing offspring free of maternal pathogens. This process is essential when mouse lines have been exposed to pathogens or when transferring lines to SPF facilities requiring specific health status.

## Rederivation Methods

### Embryo Transfer

Embryo transfer is the preferred rederivation method:

- Collection**: Harvest embryos from donor females
- Washing**: Multiple washes remove surface pathogens
- Transfer**: Transfer to SPF recipient females
- Advantages**: Most reliable, preserves genetic integrity
- Timeline**: 3 to 4 weeks to weaning

### Cesarean Section

Cesarean section provides alternative rederivation:

- Procedure**: Surgical delivery from SPF recipient
- Cross Fostering**: Transfer to SPF foster mothers
- Applications**: When embryo transfer not feasible
- Timeline**: Similar to embryo transfer

## When Rederivation is Needed

### Health Status Requirements

Rederivation required when:

- Transferring to SPF facilities
- Pathogen exposure occurred
- Health status unknown
- Facility health requirements change

### Pathogen Elimination

Rederivation eliminates:

- Viral Pathogens**: MHV, Sendai, MPV
- Bacterial Pathogens**: Mycoplasma, Helicobacter
- Parasites**: Pinworms, mites
- Other Pathogens**: As specified by facility

## Service Process

## Frequently Asked Questions

**What is rederivation and when is it needed?**

Rederivation is the process of generating pathogen-free mice from existing lines through embryo transfer or IVF into clean recipient females. It's needed when mouse lines become contaminated with pathogens, need to be moved to SPF facilities, or require health status upgrade for specific research protocols.

**What methods are used for rederivation?**

Rederivation methods include embryo transfer (collecting embryos from donor females and transferring to clean recipients), IVF (in vitro fertilization with clean sperm and eggs, then embryo transfer), and cesarean section (surgical delivery of pups to clean foster mothers). Method selection depends on line characteristics and pathogen status.

**What health testing is performed after rederivation?**

Post-rederivation health testing includes screening for standard mouse pathogens (viruses, bacteria, parasites), confirmation of pathogen-free status, and documentation of health certificates. Testing ensures rederived lines meet SPF facility requirements and are suitable for research use.

**Can rederivation preserve complex genotypes?**

Yes. Rederivation preserves the genetic integrity of mouse lines including complex genotypes, multiple alleles, and transgenic combinations. Embryo transfer or IVF methods maintain all genetic modifications while establishing pathogen-free status. Genotyping confirms genotype preservation after rederivation.
