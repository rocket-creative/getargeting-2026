# About Ingenious Targeting Laboratory

Since 1998, Ingenious Targeting Laboratory has been generating custom mouse models for researchers worldwide. From our facilities in Ronkonkoma, New York, we have completed more than 2,500 gene targeting projects contributing to over 800 peer reviewed publications across every major therapeutic area.

## Our Mission

Ingenious Targeting Laboratory exists to accelerate biomedical research by providing researchers with precisely engineered mouse models and the scientific expertise to design optimal targeting strategies. We believe that every research question deserves a thoughtfully designed model, and we work closely with investigators to translate research goals into genetically engineered solutions.

## Our History

Ingenious Targeting Laboratory was founded in 1998 to address the growing demand for custom knockout and knockin mouse models. What began as a small gene targeting service has grown into a comprehensive mouse model provider serving academic institutions, pharmaceutical companies, and biotechnology organizations worldwide.
