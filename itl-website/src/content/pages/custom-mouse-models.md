# Custom Mouse Models

Since 1998, Ingenious Targeting Laboratory has generated over 2,500 custom mouse models for researchers worldwide. Our gene targeting expertise spans knockout, knockin, humanized, and transgenic approaches.

Whether you need complete gene deletion, precise sequence insertion, human gene replacement, or targeted transgene integration, Ingenious Targeting Laboratory provides the scientific consultation and technical execution to deliver models optimized for your specific research goals.

## Knockout Mouse Models

Knockout mice carry targeted deletions that eliminate gene function, enabling loss of function studies across every therapeutic area. Ingenious Targeting Laboratory offers multiple knockout strategies tailored to your experimental requirements.

### Conventional Knockout

Conventional knockout models carry constitutive null alleles that eliminate gene function in all tissues from the earliest developmental stages. These models provide straightforward interpretation of genes that are not required for embryonic viability.

(/conventional-knockout-mouse-models)

### Conditional Knockout

Conditional knockout models use the Cre lox system to enable tissue specific or temporally controlled gene deletion. The floxed allele design preserves normal gene function until Cre recombinase excises a critical region, providing experimental control over when and where knockout occurs.

(/conditional-knockout-mouse-models)

### Tissue Specific Knockout

By crossing floxed alleles with tissue specific Cre driver lines, researchers can study gene function in specific cell populations while maintaining normal function elsewhere. This approach is essential when conventional knockout causes embryonic lethality or systemic effects that obscure tissue specific phenotypes.

(/tissue-specific-knockout)

### Inducible Knockout

Inducible systems such as tamoxifen activated CreERT2 allow temporal control over gene deletion. This enables study of gene function in adult animals and avoids developmental compensation that can mask phenotypes in constitutive models.

(/inducible-conditional-knockout)

## Knockin Mouse Models

Knockin mice carry precise sequence insertions at defined genomic locations. Unlike random transgenesis, knockin targeting ensures predictable expression levels and eliminates position effects.

### Point Mutation Knockin

Point mutation models introduce specific nucleotide changes to study disease associated variants, alter protein function, or modify regulatory elements. 

(/point-mutation-mice)

### Reporter Knockin

Reporter knockin models express fluorescent proteins, enzymatic markers, or other reporters under control of endogenous regulatory elements. This enables visualization of gene expression patterns, lineage tracing, and cell isolation based on marker expression.

(/reporter-knockin)

### Tag Knockin

Tag knockin models add epitope tags such as FLAG, HA, or V5 to endogenous proteins. These tags enable protein detection, purification, and interaction studies without requiring gene specific antibodies.

(/tag-knockin-mice)

### cDNA Knockin

cDNA knockin replaces a gene with a coding sequence, often to express modified proteins, isoform variants, or humanized sequences. The targeted approach ensures expression under endogenous regulatory control.

(/cdna-knockin)

## Humanized Mouse Models

Humanized mice carry human gene sequences in place of mouse orthologs, enabling preclinical testing of human specific therapeutics and study of human disease mechanisms.

### Gene Replacement Humanization

Complete gene replacement substitutes the entire mouse gene with its human ortholog, including regulatory elements that control expression. This approach preserves physiological expression patterns while providing human target sequences.

(/gene-replacement)

### Immune Checkpoint Humanization

Humanized immune checkpoint models express human PD1, PDL1, CTLA4, LAG3, TIM3, or other checkpoint molecules. These models enable testing of checkpoint inhibitor antibodies in immunocompetent mice with functional immune systems.

(/humanized-immune-checkpoint-mice)

### Receptor and Target Humanization

Therapeutic antibodies often show species specificity that prevents testing in standard mouse models. Humanizing the target receptor or protein enables preclinical efficacy studies in physiologically relevant contexts.

(/humanized-mouse-models)

### BAC Transgenesis

Bacterial artificial chromosome BAC targeting enables integration of large genomic segments including complete genes with native regulatory elements. This approach is valuable when physiological expression patterns are essential.

## The Ingenious Targeting Laboratory Approach

### Scientific Consultation

Every custom mouse model project begins with scientific consultation. Our team reviews your research goals, evaluates targeting strategy options, and recommends the approach most likely to deliver the experimental capabilities you need.

### Comprehensive Documentation

Every project includes detailed documentation of targeting design, germline transmission records, and genotyping protocols. This documentation supports ongoing research and future breeding programs.

## What Researchers Say

*“We engaged in the production of a number of conditional mouse models with iTL. This collaboration has been simple on my end, just providing the gene accession numbers of each gene, and iTL recommending the strategies for each gene. The full range of mouse knockout services matches my needs well. I find iTL’s service uniquely useful for my situation of needing different models for my research in a quick and efficient manner.”*

## Frequently Asked Questions

**How long does it take to generate a custom mouse model?**

Project timelines vary by model type. Conventional knockout and targeted transgenic knockin models typically require 6-8 months from project initiation to germline transmission. Conditional knockouts and cDNA knockins require 8-10 months. Timelines include targeting design, injection, breeding of founders and confirming germline transmission.

**What strain backgrounds are available for custom models?**

Ingenious Targeting Laboratory offers C57BL/6, BALB/c, and HYBRID 129 x C57BL/6 strains. C57BL/6 is most commonly requested for its well-characterized genetics and suitability for immunological studies. Strain selection depends on your research requirements and downstream breeding plans.

**What is included in a complete custom mouse model project?**

Projects include scientific consultation, targeting design, injection, founder generation, breeding to germline transmission, genotyping protocols, and delivery of F1 heterozygous mice. 

**Can Ingenious Targeting Laboratory help if I already have a targeting vector or ES cells?**

Yes. Partial service options are available for researchers with existing reagents. Services include ES cell targeting only, microinjection only, or germline transmission breeding. Contact us to discuss your specific requirements and receive a customized quote.
