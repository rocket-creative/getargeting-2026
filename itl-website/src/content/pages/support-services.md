# Mouse Model Support Services

Beyond custom mouse model generation, Ingenious Targeting Laboratory provides comprehensive support services to maintain, expand, and preserve your valuable mouse colonies. Since 1998, we have supported researchers with colony management, cryopreservation, rederivation, and breeding services that maximize research productivity while ensuring genetic integrity.

## Colony Management Services

Maintaining a productive mouse colony requires consistent husbandry, accurate genotyping, and strategic breeding decisions. Ingenious Targeting Laboratory's colony management services provide:

**Breeding Colony Maintenance** with documented pedigrees, organized mating schemes, and regular health monitoring to ensure colony productivity and genetic integrity.

**Genotyping Services** using PCR based assays to identify carriers, homozygotes, and compound mutants. Ingenious Targeting Laboratory develops custom genotyping protocols for each targeted allele.

**Cohort Development** to generate study ready animals on your timeline. We can expand from founders to experimental cohorts while you focus on research design and data analysis.

**Strain Background Management** including backcrossing to congenic backgrounds and speed congenic services using SNP marker panels to accelerate background conversion.

## Cryopreservation Services

Cryopreservation protects your mouse lines against colony loss while reducing ongoing maintenance costs. Ingenious Targeting Laboratory offers multiple preservation approaches:

**Sperm Cryopreservation** provides the most cost effective archival solution. Frozen sperm from characterized males can regenerate your line through IVF when needed.

**Embryo Cryopreservation** freezes two cell stage embryos for rapid colony recovery. This approach preserves both maternal and paternal genetics in a single archive.

**ES Cell Cryopreservation** maintains targeted ES cell clones for future use, enabling generation of additional mice or derivative alleles without repeating the targeting process.

**Archive and Recovery** services include quality controlled storage with documented inventory and validated recovery procedures to regenerate colonies from frozen stocks.

## Rederivation Services

Rederivation eliminates adventitious pathogens and establishes clean health status for mouse lines:

**Embryo Transfer Rederivation** uses IVF or natural mating to generate embryos that are transferred to pathogen free recipients, producing offspring with documented clean health status.

**Health Status Upgrade** enables transfer of lines between facilities with different health barriers or recovery of lines from compromised health status.

**Quarantine and Testing** provides documented health screening before integration into clean facilities.

## Speed Expansion Breeding

Accelerate timeline from founders to experimental cohorts:

**Superovulation Protocols** increase embryo yield from valuable females, accelerating colony expansion.

**IVF Recovery** from cryopreserved sperm enables rapid regeneration of archived lines.

**Strategic Breeding Schemes** optimize mating configurations to achieve target genotypes efficiently.

**Cohort Coordination** delivers animals at specified ages and genotypes aligned with your experimental timeline.

- Survival and endpoint analysis

### Phenotyping Services

Comprehensive phenotypic characterization of your mouse models:

- Behavioral and neurological assessment
- Metabolic phenotyping
- Immunological profiling
- Histopathological analysis

### Pharmacology Studies

Support drug development with in vivo pharmacology:

- PK PD studies in custom models
- Dose response characterization
- Biomarker validation
- Toxicology assessment

## Project Services

### Partial Services

Not every project requires end to end service. Ingenious Targeting Laboratory offers flexible engagement options:

**Targeting Vector Only** provides designed and constructed targeting vector for projects using in house ES cell facilities.

**ES Cell Targeting Only** targets client provided vectors or continues projects from existing vector constructs.

**Microinjection Only** generates chimeras from client characterized ES cell clones.

**Project Completion** brings partial projects to germline transmission from various starting points.

(/partial-services)

### Genotyping Services

Reliable genotyping supports colony management and experimental design:

**Assay Development** creates optimized PCR protocols for each targeted allele with validated primers and conditions.

**Routine Genotyping** provides rapid turnaround for breeding colony management.

**Specialized Genotyping** includes Southern blot confirmation, copy number analysis, and integration site mapping.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**What support services does ITL provide beyond model generation?**

ITL provides comprehensive support services including colony management (breeding colony maintenance, genotyping, cohort development, strain background management), cryopreservation (sperm, embryo, ES cell archival), rederivation (pathogen-free line establishment), and speed expansion breeding (rapid cohort generation).

**How do colony management services help maintain mouse lines?**

Colony management services provide breeding colony maintenance with documented pedigrees, organized mating schemes, and regular health monitoring. Genotyping services identify carriers, homozygotes, and compound mutants. Cohort development generates study-ready animals on your timeline while you focus on research design.

**What cryopreservation methods are available?**

Cryopreservation methods include sperm cryopreservation (most cost-effective archival solution), embryo cryopreservation (preserves both maternal and paternal genetics), and ES cell cryopreservation (maintains targeted ES cell clones for future use). Archive and recovery services include quality-controlled storage with validated recovery procedures.

**When is rederivation needed?**

Rederivation is needed when mouse lines become contaminated with pathogens, need to be moved to SPF facilities, or require health status upgrade for specific research protocols. Rederivation eliminates adventitious pathogens and establishes clean health status through embryo transfer or IVF into pathogen-free recipients.
