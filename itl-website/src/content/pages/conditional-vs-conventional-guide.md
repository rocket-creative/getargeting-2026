# Conditional vs Conventional Knockout

Since 1998, Ingenious Targeting Laboratory has completed over 2,500 custom gene targeting projects, helping researchers select the optimal knockout approach for their specific research goals. Understanding the differences between conditional and conventional knockout strategies is essential for designing a model that answers your scientific questions.

Both conditional and conventional knockouts create loss of function alleles, but they differ fundamentally in how and when gene inactivation occurs. This guide provides a direct comparison to help you choose the right approach for your project.

## Conventional Knockout

### How It Works

Conventional knockout permanently inactivates a gene throughout the entire organism from the earliest stages of development. The targeted allele is non functional in every cell, providing complete loss of function.

### Best Applications

- Genes that are **not essential** for embryonic development
- Studies focused on **whole organism phenotypes**
- Initial characterization of gene function
- Genes with **tissue restricted expression**
- Projects requiring **faster timelines** or **lower budgets**

### Advantages

- Simpler allele design
- Shorter project timeline 
- Lower project cost
- No Cre driver breeding required
- Complete gene inactivation guaranteed

### Limitations

- Embryonic lethality if gene is developmentally essential
- Cannot study tissue specific gene functions
- Systemic effects may mask primary phenotypes
- No temporal control
- Developmental compensation may obscure adult functions

(/conventional-knockout-mouse-models)

## Conditional Knockout

### How It Works

Conditional knockout uses the Cre lox system to control gene inactivation. LoxP sites flank critical exons, creating a "floxed" allele that functions normally until exposed to Cre recombinase. Gene deletion occurs only in cells where Cre is expressed.

### Best Applications

- Genes **essential for embryonic development**
- Studies of **tissue specific** gene function
- Genes with **pleiotropic functions** across multiple organs
- Research requiring **temporal control** over gene deletion
- Projects anticipating **multiple tissue specific studies**

### Advantages

- Bypasses embryonic lethality
- Enables tissue specific gene deletion
- Single allele works with hundreds of Cre drivers
- Temporal control with inducible Cre (CreERT2)
- Maximum experimental flexibility
- Can generate both null and conditional alleles (derivative system)

### Considerations

- Longer project timeline 
- Higher initial investment
- Requires Cre driver line for experiments
- Additional breeding generation to introduce Cre
- Must verify Cre specificity and efficiency

## Decision Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Unknown Gene Function

**Question:** "I want to understand what this gene does. Which approach should I use?"

**Recommendation:** Check if global knockout is viable (review IMPC data, literature). If viable, conventional knockout provides straightforward initial characterization. If lethal or unknown, conditional knockout with derivative allele system provides both options.

### Scenario 2: Essential Gene

**Question:** "Global knockout of my gene is embryonic lethal. How can I study it?"

**Recommendation:** Conditional knockout is required. Choose tissue specific Cre drivers relevant to your research question, or use inducible Cre to delete gene in adult animals after development is complete.

### Scenario 3: Tissue Specific Question

**Question:** "I want to know what this gene does specifically in the liver."

**Recommendation:** Conditional knockout with Albumin Cre provides hepatocyte specific deletion. This isolates liver specific gene function without confounding effects from other tissues.

### Scenario 4: Drug Target Validation

**Question:** "I want to model what happens when we inhibit this target therapeutically."

**Recommendation:** Inducible conditional knockout (CreERT2) best models acute target inhibition in adult animals, similar to drug treatment. Conventional knockout reflects lifelong absence, not drug inhibition.

### Scenario 5: Budget Constraints

**Question:** "Budget is limited. Should I choose conventional to save money?"

**Recommendation:** Only if conventional knockout is scientifically appropriate. Choosing a cheaper approach that doesn't answer your question wastes more resources than investing in the right model upfront.

## The Derivative Allele Solution

The derivative allele system eliminates the need to choose between conventional and conditional. A single targeting project generates:

- ** Knockout first allele (functions as null, potentially with LacZ reporter)
- ** Conditional ready (Flp excision creates floxed allele)
- ** Conditional null (Cre excision of stop cassette)

This approach provides:

- Immediate access to null phenotype 
- Conditional capability when needed 
- Reporter for expression analysis 
- Maximum flexibility from one investment

## Quick Decision Guide

**Choose Conventional Knockout if:**

- Gene is confirmed non essential for development
- Global phenotype is your primary interest
- Timeline and budget are significant constraints
- You don't anticipate needing tissue specific studies

**Choose Conditional Knockout if:**

- Gene is essential or potentially essential for development
- Tissue specific gene function is your question
- You need temporal control over gene deletion
- You anticipate multiple tissue specific studies
- You want maximum flexibility for future research

**Choose Derivative Allele Approach if:**

- You're uncertain about developmental essentiality
- You want both conventional and conditional options
- You value reporter expression for gene analysis
- You want to maximize return on investment

## What Researchers Say

*“iTL generated a conventional knockout mouse for us, and we were very pleased with the entire process. The project manager was extremely helpful and efficient and promptly notified us whenever a step had been completed. I highly recommend iTL’s services for anyone considering knockout mouse models.”*

## Frequently Asked Questions

**What is the main difference between conventional and conditional knockouts?**

Conventional knockouts permanently eliminate gene function in all tissues from fertilization. Conditional knockouts use the Cre-lox system to control when and where gene deletion occurs, allowing tissue-specific or temporally controlled inactivation while preserving gene function in other tissues. Conditional knockouts are essential when global deletion causes embryonic lethality.

**Can I convert a conventional knockout to a conditional knockout later?**

If the knockout was generated using a knockout-first allele design, yes. Flp recombinase converts to a conditional-ready allele. If the knockout was generated by simple exon deletion without a stop cassette system, a new conditional targeting project would be required.

**When should I choose conditional knockout over conventional?**

Choose conditional knockout if: the gene causes embryonic lethality, you need tissue-specific deletion, you want temporal control over gene deletion, you anticipate studying gene function in multiple tissues, or you want to model acute target inhibition similar to drug treatment. If the gene is non-essential and you want global deletion, conventional knockout may be sufficient.
