# Conventional Knockout Mouse Models

Since 1998, ingenious targeting laboratory has generated over 2,500 custom mouse models, including conventional knockouts - providing researchers with definitive loss of function tools for understanding gene function across every major therapeutic area.

Conventional knockout mice, also known as global or constitutive knockouts, carry complete gene inactivation in all tissues throughout development and adult life. These models establish the fundamental phenotypic consequences of gene loss and serve as the foundation for understanding target biology.

## What Is a Conventional Knockout?

A conventional knockout mouse carries a null allele that inactivates the target gene in every cell of the body from the earliest stages of development. Unlike conditional knockouts, which allow tissue specific or temporal control of gene deletion, conventional knockouts provide complete and permanent gene inactivation.

### Key Characteristics

**Global Inactivation**

The target gene is disrupted in all tissues and cell types. This provides a comprehensive view of gene function across the entire organism.

**Constitutive Expression**

Gene inactivation is present from fertilization onward. There is no temporal control over when the gene is deleted.

**Definitive Null**

When properly designed, conventional knockouts produce complete loss of gene function with no residual protein expression.

**Germline Transmission**

The null allele is transmitted through the germline, enabling breeding of stable knockout colonies.

## Applications of Conventional Knockouts

### Target Validation

Conventional knockouts establish the phenotypic consequences of complete target inhibition. Before investing in therapeutic development, researchers can assess whether target loss produces the desired biological effect.

Key questions addressed:

- What phenotypes result from complete gene loss?
- Is the gene essential for viability or fertility?
- Which organ systems are affected by gene deletion?
- Does gene loss produce the anticipated therapeutic benefit?

### Gene Function Studies

Understanding normal gene function requires observing consequences of gene absence:

**Developmental Biology**

Identify roles in embryonic development, organogenesis, and tissue differentiation.

**Physiological Studies**

Characterize contributions to normal organ function, metabolism, and homeostasis.

**Behavioral Analysis**

Assess roles in neurological function, learning, memory, and behavior.

### Disease Modeling

Knockout of disease associated genes can model human genetic conditions:

**Loss of Function Diseases**

Many genetic diseases result from gene loss or dysfunction. Knockout mice can model these conditions.

**Tumor Suppressor Biology**

Knockout of tumor suppressor genes enables cancer research, though conditional approaches are often preferred to avoid developmental lethality.

**Therapeutic Rescue Studies**

Knockout phenotypes provide endpoints for gene therapy or enzyme replacement studies.

## Allele Design for Conventional Knockouts

### Critical Exon Deletion

The most common approach deletes one or more critical exons from the target gene:

**Exon Selection Criteria**

Target early coding exons that are present in all transcript variants. Select exons whose deletion shifts the reading frame, ensuring no functional protein is produced from downstream sequences.

**Frame Shifting**

Deletion should produce a frame shift that introduces premature stop codons. This triggers nonsense mediated decay and prevents translation of truncated proteins.

**Functional Domain Disruption**

When possible, delete exons encoding critical functional domains to ensure loss of activity even if truncated protein escapes degradation.

### Selection Cassette Insertion

Gene trap approaches insert a selection cassette that disrupts transcription:

**Splice Acceptor Trapping**

A splice acceptor upstream of the selection cassette captures transcription from the endogenous promoter, preventing downstream exon expression.

**Polyadenylation Signal**

A polyadenylation signal terminates transcription within the cassette, preventing read through to downstream exons.

**LacZ Reporter**

Many knockout first designs include a LacZ reporter that enables expression monitoring at the disrupted locus.

### Knockout First Strategy

The knockout first strategy provides flexibility for researchers who may need both conventional and conditional options:

**Initial Knockout Function**

The knockout-first design disrupts gene function through cassette insertion, functioning as a conventional knockout.

**Conversion Options**

Flp recombinase removes the cassette, restoring gene function until Cre exposure. This enables generation of conditional knockouts from the same targeted line.

## Considerations for Conventional Knockouts

### Embryonic Lethality

Many genes are essential for development. Complete gene loss may result in:

**Early Embryonic Lethality**

Essential genes may cause pre implantation or early post implantation death, preventing generation of knockout mice entirely.

**Mid Gestation Lethality**

Cardiovascular, placental, or other developmental defects may cause death during organogenesis.

**Perinatal Lethality**

Some knockouts survive to birth but die shortly after due to respiratory, cardiac, or metabolic defects.

**Conditional Alternatives**

For essential genes, conditional knockouts allow study of gene function in specific tissues or adult animals after development is complete.

### Developmental Compensation

Constitutive gene loss from fertilization may trigger compensatory mechanisms:

**Genetic Compensation**

Upregulation of related genes may partially mask phenotypes that would appear with acute gene loss.

**Developmental Adaptation**

Alternative developmental pathways may bypass requirements for the deleted gene.

**Inducible Alternatives**

Tamoxifen inducible knockouts enable acute gene deletion in adults, avoiding developmental compensation.

### Background Strain Effects

Phenotypes often depend on genetic background:

**Strain Modifiers**

Modifier loci can enhance or suppress knockout phenotypes. The same mutation may produce different phenotypes on different backgrounds.

**C57BL/6 Standard**

C57BL/6 is the most common background for knockout phenotyping due to extensive characterization and availability of phenotyping databases.

**Controlled Comparisons**

Use littermate wild type controls from heterozygous crosses to ensure phenotypes are attributable to the knockout allele rather than background variation.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**What is the difference between a conventional knockout and a conditional knockout?**

A conventional knockout permanently eliminates gene function in all tissues. A conditional knockout uses the Cre-lox system to control when and where gene deletion occurs, allowing tissue-specific or temporally controlled inactivation while preserving gene function in other tissues.

**Will my conventional knockout be embryonic lethal?**

This depends on whether your target gene is essential for development. If previous studies indicate embryonic lethality, or if no knockout data exists for your gene, we recommend a conditional (floxed) allele design that can function as a conventional knockout when crossed to germline Cre, while preserving conditional options.

**How is gene function eliminated in a conventional knockout?**

Allele design ensures complete loss of function through critical exon deletion that causes frameshift and nonsense-mediated decay. 

**Can I convert a conventional knockout to a conditional knockout later?**

If your conventional knockout was generated using a knockout-first allele design, then yes. Flp recombinase converts the knockout-first allele to a conditional-ready allele. If the knockout was generated by simple exon deletion, a new conditional targeting project would be required.

**How long does it take to generate a conventional knockout mouse?**

Conventional knockout projects typically require 6-8 months from project initiation to identification of germline-transmitted F1 mice. This includes targeting design, microinjection, and breeding F0s to germline transmission.
