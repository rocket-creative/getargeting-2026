# Alzheimer Mouse Models

Since 1998, Ingenious Targeting Laboratory has supported Alzheimer disease researchers with custom mouse models contributing to peer reviewed publications in Nature Neuroscience, Neuron, Journal of Neuroscience, and leading neurology journals worldwide. Our Alzheimer disease mouse models have advanced understanding of amyloid pathology, tau biology, and the complex mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration.

Alzheimer disease mouse models enable researchers to investigate the molecular and cellular mechanisms driving disease pathogenesis, from amyloid plaque formation and tau hyperphosphorylation to neuroinflammation and synaptic dysfunction. From APP knockin models expressing familial AD mutations at physiological levels to conditional approaches enabling adult onset pathology, the right model design is critical for understanding disease biology and developing effective therapeutics.

Ingenious Targeting Laboratory designs and generates custom Alzheimer models tailored to your specific research questions, whether you're studying basic disease mechanisms, validating therapeutic targets, or testing novel interventions.

## Modeling Alzheimer Disease Pathology

### The Amyloid Cascade

Amyloid pathology remains central to Alzheimer disease modeling. Accumulation of amyloid beta (Aβ) peptides, derived from amyloid precursor protein (APP), drives plaque formation and downstream neurotoxicity. Mouse models targeting the amyloid pathway include:

- APP mutations:** Familial AD mutations (Swedish, London, Indiana) increase Aβ production or shift the Aβ42/40 ratio
- Presenilin mutations:** PSEN1 and PSEN2 mutations affect gamma secretase processing of APP
- Combination models:** Multiple mutations accelerate pathology for faster experimental readouts

### Tau Pathology

Tau hyperphosphorylation and neurofibrillary tangle formation correlate closely with cognitive decline in AD. Tau models enable study of this critical pathological feature:

- MAPT mutations:** Frontotemporal dementia associated mutations (P301L, P301S) promote tau aggregation
- Humanized tau:** Complete replacement of mouse tau with human MAPT
- Tau knockin:** Human tau mutations expressed from the endogenous locus at physiological levels

### Combined Amyloid and Tau Models

The interaction between amyloid and tau pathology is a key focus of AD research. Models combining both pathways enable study of:

- Amyloid driven tau spreading
- Synergistic effects on neurodegeneration
- Therapeutic interventions targeting both pathways

## Model Types for Alzheimer Research

### APP Knockin Models

APP knockin models express familial AD mutations from the endogenous App locus, providing physiological expression levels and normal regulatory control. Advantages include:

- No overexpression artifacts
- Physiological APP expression levels
- Normal tissue distribution and processing
- Humanized Aβ sequence for translational relevance

APP knockin models develop amyloid pathology progressively, better modeling the age dependent nature of AD compared to high expressing transgenic approaches.

### Transgenic Overexpression Models

Transgenic models expressing mutant APP, PSEN1, or tau under strong promoters develop pathology rapidly:

- Tg2576:** Swedish APP mutation, moderate plaque pathology
- 5xFAD:** Five familial AD mutations, aggressive amyloid pathology
- APP/PS1:** Combined APP and PSEN1 mutations
- 3xTg AD:** Triple transgenic with APP, PSEN1, and tau mutations

Overexpression models provide faster pathology development but may include artifacts from supraphysiological protein levels.

### Tau Models

### Conditional Approaches

Conditional models enable temporal and spatial control over AD gene expression:

- Inducible APP/tau expression:** Trigger pathology onset in adult animals
- Cell type specific expression:** Restrict pathogenic proteins to neurons or glia
- Adult onset models:** Bypass developmental effects to model late onset disease

## Research Applications

### Understanding Disease Mechanisms

Genetically engineered mouse models have been essential for understanding AD pathophysiology:

- Amyloid processing and aggregation
- Tau phosphorylation and spreading
- Microglial activation and neuroinflammation
- Synaptic dysfunction and neurodegeneration
- Blood brain barrier disruption
- Gut microbiota brain axis interactions

### Drug Target Validation

Mouse models support therapeutic development by enabling target validation:

- Genetic ablation of putative targets
- Humanized targets for antibody testing
- Conditional knockouts modeling pharmacological inhibition
- Biomarker development and validation

### Therapeutic Testing

AD mouse models provide platforms for preclinical efficacy testing:

- Anti amyloid therapeutics (antibodies, secretase inhibitors)
- Tau targeting approaches (aggregation inhibitors, immunotherapy)
- Neuroprotective strategies
- Combination therapies

Knockin models provide more physiologically relevant disease modeling but require longer timelines for pathology development. Transgenic models offer faster readouts but may include artifacts from overexpression.

### Pre Germline Characterization

ES cell based targeting enables comprehensive characterization of AD alleles before mouse generation. This pre germline analysis confirms correct mutation sequence, proper allele structure, and absence of random integration events.

For knockin models expressing familial AD mutations, sequence verification confirms the exact pathogenic change has been incorporated. The characterized ES cell clone provides a defined starting point for model generation.

### Strain Background Considerations

Strain background significantly impacts AD related phenotypes:

- C57BL/6:** Most common background, extensive baseline data, Th1 biased immunity
- 129 strains:** Variable behavioral phenotypes, may affect cognitive assessments
- Mixed backgrounds:** Can introduce variability in pathology and behavior

C57BL/6 is generally preferred for AD models to enable consistent behavioral testing and comparison with published literature.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**What is the difference between knockin and transgenic Alzheimer models?**

Knockin models introduce mutations at the endogenous gene locus under native regulatory control, providing physiological expression levels but slower pathology onset (12+ months). Transgenic models use random integration with promoters, providing faster pathology (3-6 months) but may include overexpression artifacts. Knockin models are more physiologically relevant; transgenic models offer faster readouts.

**Which AD mutations can be modeled in mice?**

Common familial AD mutations include APP mutations (Swedish, London, etc.), PSEN1 mutations (multiple variants), and PSEN2 mutations. Tau mutations (FTDP-17) model tauopathies. Point mutation knockins can introduce any specific human mutation at physiological levels for disease modeling.

**What strain background is best for AD models?**

C57BL/6 is most commonly used for AD models because it has extensive behavioral baseline data, good learning performance, and enables consistent comparison with published literature. C57BL/6 also provides well-characterized immune responses, which is important given the role of neuroinflammation in AD.

**How long does it take to see AD pathology in mouse models?**

Knockin models with APP or PSEN mutations typically develop amyloid pathology over 12-18 months. Tau pathology may develop earlier or later depending on the specific mutation. Transgenic models often show faster pathology (3-6 months) but may include overexpression artifacts. Pathology timing should be considered when planning studies.
