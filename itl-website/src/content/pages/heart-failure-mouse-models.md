# Heart Failure Mouse Models

Since 1998, Ingenious Targeting Laboratory has supported cardiovascular research with custom knockout, knockin, and conditional mouse models for heart failure studies. Our gene targeting expertise enables investigation of the molecular mechanisms driving cardiomyopathy, cardiac remodeling, and contractile dysfunction.

Whether you are studying inherited cardiomyopathies, modeling pressure or volume overload induced heart failure, or validating therapeutic targets, Ingenious Targeting Laboratory provides models optimized for your cardiac research goals.

## Heart Failure Pathophysiology

Heart failure represents the final common pathway for multiple cardiac diseases, characterized by impaired contractile function and inadequate cardiac output. Mouse models enable study of the genetic, molecular, and cellular mechanisms underlying cardiac dysfunction.

### Dilated Cardiomyopathy

Dilated cardiomyopathy is characterized by ventricular dilation and systolic dysfunction. Genetic forms result from mutations in sarcomeric proteins, cytoskeletal components, or ion channels. Mouse models carrying human disease associated mutations enable study of disease mechanisms and therapeutic testing.

### Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy features abnormal cardiac hypertrophy, often caused by sarcomeric gene mutations. Mouse models enable study of hypertrophic signaling pathways and diastolic dysfunction.

### Cardiac Remodeling

Pathological cardiac remodeling in response to hemodynamic stress involves cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, fibrosis, and changes in gene expression. Understanding the signaling pathways driving maladaptive remodeling is essential for developing therapies that prevent heart failure progression.

## Custom Model Approaches

### Sarcomeric Protein Mutations

Point mutation knockin models enable study of disease causing mutations in sarcomeric genes including MYH7, MYBPC3, TNNT2, and TNNI3. These models reproduce human cardiomyopathy phenotypes and enable mechanistic studies.

### Signaling Pathway Modulation

Knockout and conditional knockout models enable study of signaling pathways involved in cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, and failure. Common targets include kinases, transcription factors, and metabolic regulators.

### Cardiac Specific Knockouts

Cardiac specific gene deletion using alpha myosin heavy chain Cre (αMHC Cre) or myosin light chain Cre (MLC Cre) enables study of gene function specifically in cardiomyocytes without affecting other tissues.

This approach is essential when systemic knockout causes embryonic lethality or when cardiac specific phenotypes need to be distinguished from systemic effects.

### Inducible Cardiac Knockouts

Tamoxifen inducible cardiac Cre lines such as αMHC MerCreMer enable adult onset gene deletion. This approach avoids developmental effects and enables study of gene function in the adult heart.

## Ion Channel and Calcium Handling Models

### Arrhythmia Models

Mutations in cardiac ion channels cause inherited arrhythmia syndromes including long QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome, and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. Mouse models enable study of arrhythmia mechanisms and testing of antiarrhythmic therapies.

### Calcium Handling Defects

Alterations in calcium cycling proteins including SERCA2a, phospholamban, and ryanodine receptor contribute to heart failure progression. Models modifying these genes enable study of calcium handling in cardiac dysfunction.

## Cardiac Fibrosis Models

### Fibroblast Specific Modifications

Cardiac fibrosis involves activation of fibroblasts and excessive extracellular matrix deposition. Fibroblast specific Cre lines enable study of gene function specifically in the fibroblast population.

### TGF Beta Pathway Models

The TGF beta pathway plays central roles in cardiac fibrosis. Models modifying TGF beta ligands, receptors, or downstream signaling components enable study of profibrotic mechanisms.

## Applications in Heart Failure Research

### Disease Mechanism Studies

Custom models enable investigation of specific genes and pathways in heart failure pathogenesis, from initial insult through remodeling to overt failure.

### Therapeutic Target Validation

Knockout and knockin models validate potential therapeutic targets by demonstrating that target modulation affects disease phenotypes.

### Drug Efficacy Testing

Models that develop measurable cardiac phenotypes enable preclinical testing of therapeutic interventions. Endpoints can include echocardiographic function, survival, histological changes, and molecular markers.

### Gene Therapy Development

Mouse models provide platforms for testing cardiac gene therapy approaches, including AAV mediated gene delivery and gene editing strategies.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**What Cre drivers are used for heart failure studies?**

Common cardiac Cre drivers include Myh6-Cre (cardiomyocytes), Tcf21-MerCreMer (cardiac fibroblasts, inducible), Postn-Cre (activated fibroblasts), and alphaMHC-CreERT2 (inducible cardiomyocyte). Selection depends on whether you're studying cardiomyocyte function, fibroblast activation, or combined cardiac remodeling mechanisms.

**How do you model heart failure in mice?**

Heart failure can be modeled through pressure overload (transverse aortic constriction), myocardial infarction (coronary ligation), genetic modifications affecting cardiac contractility or metabolism, or point mutations modeling human cardiomyopathy variants. Conditional approaches enable tissue-specific study of genes involved in heart failure without developmental lethality.

**Can you create inducible heart failure models?**

Yes. Tamoxifen-inducible Cre (CreER) enables temporal control of gene deletion in cardiomyocytes or fibroblasts, allowing study of adult-onset heart failure mechanisms without developmental effects. This is particularly useful for genes with essential developmental functions that would cause embryonic lethality if deleted constitutively.

**How do you validate cardiac function in heart failure models?**

Cardiac function validation includes echocardiography (ejection fraction, fractional shortening, wall motion), hemodynamic assessment (pressure-volume loops), histological analysis (cardiomyocyte size, fibrosis), and molecular markers (BNP, ANP, beta-MHC). Models are validated before delivery to ensure proper cardiac phenotypes.
