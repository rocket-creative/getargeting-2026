# Mouse Phenotyping Services

Ingenious Targeting Laboratory provides comprehensive phenotyping services to characterize your custom mouse models across multiple biological parameters. Phenotyping reveals the functional consequences of genetic modifications and informs experimental design for downstream studies.

From basic clinical observations through specialized disease specific endpoints, our phenotyping capabilities help you understand your model's biology and validate its utility for your research program.

## Basic Phenotyping

Basic phenotyping establishes foundational characterization of your mouse model and identifies overt phenotypes affecting health, development, or survival.

### Body Weight and Growth

Longitudinal body weight monitoring tracks growth curves and identifies developmental abnormalities or metabolic phenotypes. Weight data enables comparison with wild type littermates and detection of genotype dependent effects.

### Survival Analysis

Survival tracking identifies premature mortality and enables Kaplan Meier analysis of lifespan effects. This is essential for models with potential lethality.

### Clinical Observations

Regular clinical observation identifies behavioral changes, neurological signs, gait abnormalities, and other visible phenotypes. Standardized scoring systems enable quantitative tracking.

### Gross Anatomy

Necropsy with organ weight measurement identifies organomegaly, atrophy, or structural abnormalities. Gross pathology guides selection of tissues for histological analysis.

## Clinical Chemistry and Hematology

### Serum Chemistry

Clinical chemistry panels assess metabolic, hepatic, and renal function:

**Metabolic panel**: Glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides, free fatty acids.

**Liver function**: ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, albumin.

**Kidney function**: BUN, creatinine.

**Electrolytes**: Sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, phosphorus.

### Hematology

Complete blood count (CBC) with differential identifies hematopoietic phenotypes affecting red cells, white cells, and platelets. Reticulocyte counts assess erythropoietic activity.

### Specialized Assays

Cytokine panels, hormone levels, and other specialized biomarker assays are available based on your model's expected phenotype.

## Histopathology

### Tissue Collection

Standardized tissue collection protocols ensure optimal preservation for histological analysis. Collection can be customized based on expected phenotype.

### Routine Histology

Hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining provides overview of tissue architecture and pathology. Standard panels include major organs; custom panels focus on tissues of interest.

### Special Stains

Special histochemical stains highlight specific tissue components:

**Fibrosis**: Masson's trichrome, Sirius red.

**Lipid**: Oil Red O (frozen sections).

**Glycogen**: PAS staining.

**Mucins**: Alcian blue.

### Immunohistochemistry

Immunohistochemical staining detects specific proteins in tissue sections, enabling assessment of cell populations, pathway activation, and protein localization.

### Pathology Interpretation

Board certified veterinary pathologists provide expert interpretation of histological findings with standardized scoring and detailed reports.

## Disease Specific Phenotyping

### Metabolic Phenotyping

**Glucose tolerance testing (GTT)**: Measures glucose clearance after glucose challenge.

**Insulin tolerance testing (ITT)**: Assesses insulin sensitivity.

**Body composition**: DEXA or MRI based measurement of fat and lean mass.

**Metabolic cages**: Indirect calorimetry for energy expenditure, food intake, and activity.

### Cardiovascular Phenotyping

**Echocardiography**: Non invasive assessment of cardiac function, including ejection fraction, wall thickness, and chamber dimensions.

**Blood pressure**: Tail cuff or telemetry based blood pressure monitoring.

**ECG**: Electrocardiographic assessment of cardiac rhythm.

(/cardiovascular-mouse-models)

### Behavioral Phenotyping

**Open field**: General activity and anxiety like behavior.

**Elevated plus maze**: Anxiety assessment.

**Rotarod**: Motor coordination and balance.

**Morris water maze**: Spatial learning and memory.

**Fear conditioning**: Associative learning.

(/neuroscience-mouse-models)

### Immune Phenotyping

**Flow cytometry**: Multi parameter analysis of immune cell populations in blood, spleen, lymph nodes, and tissues.

**Cytokine profiling**: Serum or tissue cytokine levels.

## Phenotyping Study Design

### Cohort Planning

We work with you to determine appropriate cohort sizes, age at analysis, and sex considerations based on your expected phenotype and statistical requirements.

### Control Selection

Appropriate controls (wild type littermates, heterozygotes, or Cre only controls) are essential for phenotype interpretation. We help design control groups for your study.

### Data Delivery

Phenotyping reports include complete methodology, raw data, statistical analysis, and interpretation. Data packages are formatted to support publications and regulatory submissions.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**What types of phenotyping services does ITL provide?**

ITL provides comprehensive phenotyping services including metabolic phenotyping (glucose tolerance, insulin tolerance, body composition, metabolic cages), cardiovascular phenotyping (echocardiography, blood pressure, ECG), behavioral phenotyping (open field, elevated plus maze, rotarod, Morris water maze, fear conditioning), and immune phenotyping (flow cytometry, cytokine profiling).

**How do you design a phenotyping study?**

Phenotyping study design includes determining appropriate cohort sizes based on expected phenotype and statistical requirements, selecting age at analysis (considering developmental timing and disease progression), sex considerations (males vs females, or both), appropriate controls (wild-type littermates, vehicle-treated controls), and timeline planning for longitudinal studies.

**What is included in phenotyping service deliverables?**

Phenotyping service deliverables include comprehensive data reports with quantitative results, statistical analysis comparing experimental groups to controls, histological images and analysis when applicable, functional assessment results (behavioral, metabolic, cardiovascular), and interpretation guidance for understanding results in context of your research question.

**Can phenotyping be performed on existing mouse models?**

Yes. ITL can perform phenotyping on models you already have, models generated by ITL, or models obtained from other sources. We work with you to design appropriate phenotyping strategies based on your model type, research question, and expected phenotypes.
