# Tumor Suppressor Knockout Mice

Since 1998, Ingenious Targeting Laboratory has generated tumor suppressor knockout models for cancer researchers worldwide. Disruption of tumor suppressor genes is fundamental to understanding cancer initiation, progression, and therapeutic response. Our gene targeting expertise spans p53, Rb, PTEN, APC, BRCA1/2, and other tumor suppressor genes across all cancer types.

Whether you need constitutive knockouts for germline tumor predisposition studies or conditional models for tissue specific tumorigenesis, Ingenious Targeting Laboratory provides the scientific consultation and technical execution to deliver models optimized for your oncology research.

## Tumor Suppressor Biology

Tumor suppressor genes normally function to restrict cell proliferation, promote apoptosis, maintain genomic stability, or repair DNA damage. Loss of tumor suppressor function through mutation or deletion enables uncontrolled cell growth and is a hallmark of cancer development.

### Categories of Tumor Suppressors

**Gatekeeper genes** directly regulate cell proliferation or death. Loss of gatekeepers such as Rb or p53 immediately promotes cellular transformation.

**Caretaker genes** maintain genomic integrity through DNA repair or chromosome segregation. Loss of caretakers such as BRCA1 or MLH1 leads to accumulation of mutations and genomic instability.

**Landscaper genes** affect the tissue microenvironment and influence tumor development indirectly through effects on stroma or immune cells.

## Common Tumor Suppressor Targets

### p53 (Trp53)

p53 is mutated or deleted in the majority of human cancers. Constitutive p53 knockout mice develop tumors spontaneously, while conditional p53 knockouts enable tissue specific tumor studies without early mortality.

p53 conditional alleles crossed with tissue specific Cre lines enable study of p53 loss in specific organs such as lung, breast, colon, or hematopoietic system.

### Rb (Rb1)

The retinoblastoma protein controls G1/S cell cycle transition. Rb knockout mice develop pituitary and thyroid tumors, while conditional Rb deletion enables study of tissue specific effects.

### PTEN

PTEN is a phosphatase that negatively regulates the PI3K/AKT pathway. PTEN loss occurs commonly in prostate, breast, and brain cancers. Conditional PTEN knockouts develop tissue specific tumors with high penetrance.

### APC

APC mutations drive colorectal cancer through constitutive Wnt signaling activation. APC conditional knockouts enable study of intestinal adenoma development and progression to carcinoma.

### BRCA1 and BRCA2

BRCA genes maintain genomic stability through homologous recombination DNA repair. Conditional BRCA knockouts in mammary or ovarian epithelium enable study of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer.

## Knockout Strategy Considerations

### Constitutive vs Conditional Knockout

Constitutive tumor suppressor knockouts often cause embryonic lethality or early death from tumors, limiting their utility for studying adult cancer. Conditional knockouts enable tumor suppressor deletion in specific tissues at defined times.

### Tissue Specific Deletion

Crossing conditional (floxed) tumor suppressor alleles with tissue specific Cre lines enables gene deletion in the tissue of interest. This approach generates tumors in clinically relevant organs without affecting other tissues.

Common Cre drivers for cancer models include MMTV Cre (mammary), Villin Cre (intestine), Albumin Cre (liver), K14 Cre (skin), and GFAP Cre (brain).

### Inducible Deletion

Tamoxifen inducible Cre lines enable temporal control over tumor suppressor deletion. This approach models sporadic tumor development and enables study of tumor suppressor loss in adult tissues.

## Multi Gene Cancer Models

### Compound Knockouts

Cancer typically requires loss of multiple tumor suppressors. Compound conditional knockouts enable simultaneous deletion of multiple genes to study cooperating mutations.

Common combinations include p53/PTEN double knockouts, p53/Rb double knockouts, and APC/p53 combinations.

### Tumor Suppressor Plus Oncogene

Combining tumor suppressor knockout with oncogene activation generates aggressive tumor models. Conditional Kras activation combined with p53 deletion is widely used for lung and pancreatic cancer models.

## Applications

### Tumor Biology Studies

Tumor suppressor knockouts enable study of cancer initiation, progression, and metastasis in physiologically relevant contexts.

### Drug Development

Genetically defined tumor models enable preclinical testing of targeted therapies and evaluation of synthetic lethal approaches.

### Biomarker Discovery

Models with defined genetic lesions support identification of biomarkers associated with tumor suppressor loss.

### Immunotherapy Studies

Tumor suppressor knockout models on immunocompetent backgrounds enable study of tumor immune interactions and testing of immunotherapies.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**What tumor suppressor genes are commonly targeted for cancer research?**

Common tumor suppressor targets include p53 (Trp53), Rb (Rb1), PTEN, APC, BRCA1/2, and other tumor suppressors across all cancer types. Selection depends on cancer type, research question, and whether you're studying tumor initiation, progression, or therapeutic response.

**Should I use conventional or conditional knockout for tumor suppressors?**

Conventional tumor suppressor knockouts often cause embryonic lethality or early death from tumors, limiting utility for adult cancer studies. Conditional knockouts enable tissue-specific or temporal tumor suppressor deletion, allowing study of adult-onset tumorigenesis without developmental lethality.

**What Cre drivers are used for tissue-specific tumor suppressor studies?**

Common Cre drivers for tumor suppressor studies include tissue-specific promoters (e.g., Albumin-Cre for liver, Villin-Cre for intestine, Keratin14-Cre for skin) and inducible Cre (CreER) for temporal control. Selection depends on whether you're studying organ-specific tumorigenesis or need temporal control over tumor development.

**How do you validate tumor suppressor knockout phenotypes?**

Tumor suppressor knockout validation includes tumor incidence and latency analysis, histological assessment (tumor type, grade, stage), molecular markers (pathway activation, proliferation markers), and survival analysis. Models are validated before delivery to ensure appropriate tumor phenotypes.
