# Mouse Colony Management Services

Since 1998, Ingenious Targeting Laboratory has supported researchers with comprehensive colony management services, maintaining and expanding genetically engineered mouse lines for institutions worldwide. Our colony management expertise ensures your valuable mouse models are maintained with consistent genotyping, optimized breeding strategies, and professional animal husbandry.

Colony management services enable research programs to focus on experimental work while experts handle the logistics of maintaining breeding colonies, tracking genotypes, and expanding lines for experimental cohorts. Whether you need ongoing colony maintenance, rapid expansion for a large study, or professional management of complex multi allele breeding schemes, Ingenious Targeting Laboratory provides the infrastructure and expertise to support your research program.

Our facility maintains SPF (specific pathogen free) health status, enabling direct transfer of animals to most research institutions without quarantine. Combined with our experience managing thousands of genetically engineered lines, colony management services provide a reliable foundation for your research.

# Service Overview

## Colony Maintenance

Ongoing colony maintenance keeps your mouse lines healthy and productive:

- Breeding pair management:** Maintain optimal breeding pairs for continuous production
- Genotype tracking:** Systematic genotyping and record keeping
- Health monitoring:** Regular health assessment and veterinary oversight
- Census management:** Track animal numbers, ages, and genotypes
- Reporting:** Regular updates on colony status and production

Maintenance colonies ensure your lines remain available without consuming space and resources at your home institution.

## Breeding Expansion

Rapid expansion services generate experimental cohorts efficiently:

- Cohort development:** Breed to specific genotypes and numbers for experiments
- Age matched cohorts:** Coordinate breeding for age synchronized animals
- Sex balanced groups:** Generate appropriate male and female numbers
- Timeline optimization:** Strategic breeding to meet experimental deadlines
- Large scale production:** Scale colony for high throughput studies

## Complex Breeding Schemes

Multi allele breeding requires careful genetic management:

- Conditional knockout breeding:** Floxed allele crossed to Cre driver
- Multi allele combinations:** Compound mutants with multiple modifications
- Reporter crosses:** Breeding for lineage tracing or expression analysis
- Backcrossing programs:** Systematic strain background purification
- Intercross management:** Generating homozygotes from heterozygote crosses

Our team designs breeding schemes optimized for your specific genetic combinations and experimental timeline.

# Genotyping Services

## Routine Genotyping

Accurate genotyping is essential for colony management:

- PCR based genotyping:** Standard endpoint PCR for allele detection
- Multiplex assays:** Simultaneous detection of multiple alleles
- Quantitative genotyping:** Distinguish heterozygotes from homozygotes
- Cre detection:** Confirm presence of Cre transgene
- Quality control:** Validated assays with appropriate controls

## Assay Development

For new alleles or complex genotypes, we develop and validate custom genotyping assays:

- Primer design for targeted alleles
- Assay optimization and validation
- Positive and negative control establishment
- Protocol documentation for technology transfer

# Breeding Strategies

## Heterozygote Maintenance

Most colonies are maintained as heterozygotes to preserve fertility and viability:

- Cross heterozygote to wildtype for maintenance breeding
- All offspring are heterozygous or wildtype
- Avoids potential homozygous lethality or infertility
- Genotyping distinguishes carriers from non carriers

## Homozygote Production

Experimental cohorts often require homozygous animals:

- Intercross heterozygotes to generate homozygotes
- Expected ratio: 25% homozygous, 50% heterozygous, 25% wildtype
- Genotyping identifies desired animals
- Littermate controls available from same breeding

## Conditional Knockout Breeding

Generating conditional knockouts requires multi step breeding:

# Facility and Health Status

## SPF Health Status

Our facility maintains SPF (specific pathogen free) health status:

- Regular sentinel testing for common mouse pathogens
- Barrier housing with controlled access
- HEPA filtered air handling
- Autoclaved bedding and supplies
- Health certification provided with shipments

SPF status enables direct transfer to most research institutions without quarantine, accelerating your research timeline.

## Animal Care Standards

Professional animal husbandry ensures colony health:

- AAALAC accredited or equivalent standards
- Experienced animal care technicians
- Veterinary oversight and consultation
- Environmental enrichment
- Detailed health and breeding records

## Shipping and Transfer

Coordinated transfer to your institution:

- Temperature controlled shipping

# Integration with Model Generation

## Seamless Transition

Colony management services integrate directly with model generation projects:

- Germline confirmed founders transition directly to colony management
- No need to ship animals to your institution then return for expansion
- Continuous care from model generation through cohort delivery
- Single point of contact throughout the process

## Post Project Services

After model generation, colony management supports your research program:

- Cohort development:** Breed study ready animals for your experiments
- Colony expansion:** Scale production for large studies
- Line preservation:** Maintain backup colonies
- Cryopreservation:** Archive lines for long term storage

## Frequently Asked Questions

**What is included in colony management services?**

Colony management includes breeding to maintain your mouse lines, genotyping to identify animals with desired alleles, health monitoring, cohort production for experiments, and reporting on colony status. Services can be customized based on your needs, from simple maintenance breeding to complex multi-allele cohort production.

**How do you maintain SPF (specific pathogen free) health status?**

Our facility uses strict barrier protocols including HEPA-filtered ventilated caging, autoclaved bedding and food, routine sentinel testing, and controlled access. All animals are tested for common murine pathogens. Rederivation services are available to clean up lines with compromised health status.

**Can you manage breeding for conditional knockout experiments?**

Yes. Conditional knockout breeding involves multiple crosses to combine floxed alleles with Cre drivers and generate experimental cohorts with proper controls. We design breeding schemes to minimize generations and maximize cohort yield, including littermate controls.

**How do I transfer my mouse lines to your facility?**

Lines can be transferred as live animals (with health certification) or as cryopreserved embryos or sperm. We coordinate with your institutional vivarium for shipping logistics. All incoming lines undergo quarantine and health testing before entering the main colony.
