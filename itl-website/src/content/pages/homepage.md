• Multi-generation cohort development and colony planning for study readiness.

• Animal model catalog access to 10,000+ lines for study-ready biomedical research. 

• Integrated non-GLP preclinical services for your custom or catalog model to support translational decisions

## Modern Model-Generation Landscape

Across today's research environment, scientists utilize a wide array of genome-modification technologies, including programmable nucleases, rapid-editing strategies, exploratory one-cell–stage modifications, and other contemporary editing systems used throughout the field. These approaches and others are discussed with an emphasis on structured allele design, stable inheritance, and multi-generational reproducibility for long-term performance aligned with your specific study requirements.

## ingenious targeting laboratory's High-Level Approach

### Optimized Targeting Strategy

We evaluate all available genome engineering technologies to determine the best method for your specific research goals. Technology selection is based on allele complexity, stability requirements, and reproducibility standards.

### U.S.-Based QC Oversight

Each stage of custom development—allele confirmation, germline transmission, colony establishment, and cohort expansion—is validated through U.S.-based QC. This comprehensive oversight ensures consistent quality and reliable results across all project phases.

### Project Backgrounds

The C57BL/6 background ensures reproducibility across cohorts, replicates, and multi-site studies to eliminate confounding variables and support consistent phenotypic outcomes.

### Structured Allele Design

Allele designs are chosen to support reliable and consistent performance across downstream assays. This includes constitutive knockout, conditional knockout, reporter gene insertion, knock-in (point mutation, cDNA), and humanization projects, all designed to maintain stable inheritance and interpretable outcomes across generations.
