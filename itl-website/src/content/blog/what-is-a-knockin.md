# What Is A Knockin?

## What Is a Knockin Mouse and Why Is It Used?

The gene knockin method, as well as knockin mouse models, can help us further our understanding of some of the most advanced research methods used in modern science and prove useful for a variety of applications in research, medicine and biotechnology. As researchers continue to learn more about the human genome and the role that each gene plays in the body, transgenic and knockin mouse models continue to be essential by allowing scientists to assign functions to genes, dissect genetic pathways, and manipulate the cellular or biochemical properties of proteins. Knockin mice are generated by knocking in a gene at a specific location and are utilized to shed light on the complexity of the human genome and the subsequent genetic mutations caused by the knockin gene insertion. Knockin mouse models have become powerful reagents for modeling genetic disorders, understanding embryonic development and evaluating therapeutics.

### An Overview of the Gene Knockin Process

What is a knockin and why is it so useful in the world of genetic research and engineering? A knockin defines a biological model in which a gene sequence is inserted at a particular locus. This technology is often used for the creation of disease models. Knockins are typically used in any research field. Different types of knockins include constitutive knockins, humanization knockins, reporter/tag knockins, and targeting transgenics that utilize the Rosa26 locus which provides full control of the gene expression. Scientists often use ES cells to insert an entirely new gene into a particular locus within the genome. This targeted insertion can result in a genetic mutation. In order to study the development of diseases and their effects in vivo, researchers often use knockin laboratory mouse models.

### How Does the Gene Knockin Method Work?

What is a knockin gene replacement and how is it used? The process of creating a knockin animal – most often a knockin mouse – involves targeted gene replacement mostly through homologous recombination. Typically, procedures such as Cre recombinase with gene vectors and LoxP flanking sites are used, but some methods also use the lox511 sequence, which is equally effective in Cre-Lox recombination.

### The Diversity of Knockin Mouse Models

At ingenious targeting laboratory, we can generate a custom knockin mouse model that’s tailored to your next research project. Our classic and advanced technologies allow us to generate quality and precise models with fast timelines. For point mutations and cassette insertions, both conventional and conditional strategies are available.

In order to more accurately model human disease, we’ve developed our exclusive TruHumanization™ technology. What sets it apart from other strategies is that it’s possible to completely replace a mouse sequence with human sequence, resulting in a faithful and predictable knockin mouse model.

For more certainty, we can add a fluorescent reporter to your knockin mouse model to confirm the location of your knocked in gene, monitor gene expression, and more. Other design options include point mutations and cassette insertions, with both conventional and conditional approaches available.
