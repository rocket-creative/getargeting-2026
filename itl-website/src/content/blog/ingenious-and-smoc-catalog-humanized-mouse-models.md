## INGENIOUS TARGETING LABORATORY AND SMOC SIGN AGREEMENT TO PRODUCE AND DISTRIBUTE CATALOG MOUSE MODELS

Ronkonkoma, New York and Shanghai, China — April 14, 2021 – ingenious targeting laboratory, a leading provider of custom animal models for in vivo studies, and Shanghai Model Organisms Center, “SMOC,” a major supplier of laboratory rodents and services, announced a partnership that grants rights for ingenious targeting laboratory to distribute SMOC’s validated off-the-shelf mouse models in North America and Europe. This follows upon an agreement which grants SMOC the right to market ingenious’ custom large humanization mouse model services in China. The companies’ strict adherence to common practices for rodent health and genetic monitoring will ensure minimal variation between the animals produced in China and North America, for researchers worldwide.

For over twenty years, SMOC has produced genetically modified mouse models for researchers around the globe. The company has generated over 8000 mouse strains, including over 3000 study-ready models. Most notably, their humanized PD-1/PD-L1, TIGIT, and SIRPA/CD47 strains are highly demanded by industrial clients for antibody drug efficacy studies. These strains will be sold by ingenious targeting laboratory, as well as many other immune checkpoint humanized mouse strains.

In addition, SMOC is known as a “one-stop shop,” as their service offerings include custom mouse models, catalog mouse models, breeding services, and phenotypic analysis. Through this collaboration, customers in China can purchase advanced custom models created using ingenious’ exclusive TruHumanization™ gene replacement technology. Furthermore, ingenious targeting laboratory will expand its current services beyond custom mouse, rat, and rabbit generation, breeding, and genotyping. Clients can now enjoy the convenience of purchasing SMOC’s research-ready catalog models through ingenious as a trusted vendor.

“The demand for our off-the-shelf mouse models has increased steadily in China over the last few years. This partnership with ingenious will only expand the use of these lines that we have generated in China for North American and European researchers at both the academic and Pharma/biotech sectors. We see the demand for many of these lines worldwide and ingenious targeting laboratory is highly regarded for their custom generation, breeding and delivery of high quality models,” said Mingjun Wang, President of SMOC.

“We are excited that ingenious will be able to distribute the validated targeting lines that SMOC has produced. By introducing SMOC’s unique systems of production and quality control, we are confident that we will offer high quality animals,” said Paul Sheiffele, President of ingenious targeting laboratory. “Extensive access of these off-the-shelf models will speed the use of mouse models for scientists in their studies.”
