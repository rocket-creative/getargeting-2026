## What Is a Knockout Rat and What Is Its Main Purpose?

What is a knockout rat, and what makes these animals such an important tool for examining the human genome? In the field of genetic research and drug development, scientists have been studying knockout genes in animal models, with DNA similar to that of humans, for years. However, while knockout mouse models have provided scientists with a window of opportunity to discover the functions of human genes and to study human diseases, the limitations posed by laboratory mice have been equally evident. Fortunately, during the past few years, scientists have developed new knockout rats with similar qualities as knockout mice.

So, what is a knockout rat, and why are these animals needed when scientists already use knockout mice? According to numerous studies, rats are actually much closer physiologically to humans than mice. Although the human genome is quite different from the genetic makeup of knockout rat models, many rat genes are similar to those in human DNA. This makes it possible for genetic researchers to gain a greater understanding of human DNA and physiology by studying knockout genes in lab rats. Some of the best results have been obtained in studies examining the cardiovascular and autoimmune systems, as well as all areas of the body that are affected by diseases like diabetes, arthritis, or addictive disorders.

Even though rat models have already been around for years, the idea of making knockout rats feasible and economically worthwhile wasn’t heavily pursued until 2008. The reason why rats were not as widely used in the past is because scientists found it extremely difficult to culture and work with their embryonic stem cells. That changed after gene editing tools became more prevalent, making it easier to generate knockout rats, which changed the face of genetic research as we knew it. Several new methods have been developed over the years, such as zinc-finger nuclease technology, TALENs technology and CRISPR. It’s possible to create knockout rat models through these means once knockout mutations are first created, and then later through the use and breeding of rat lines designed to express Cre recombinase at a tissue-specific level.

What are knockout rat models and what are the benefits of using them in a study? The answer to this question is simple: knockout rats are rats that have a certain gene inactivated for the purpose of studying how it can influence all of the processes in the body. One clear advantage of knockout rats is that rats have already been used as part of laboratory experiments for many years. The body of knowledge available on rat physiology is extensive, allowing scientists to reach more accurate conclusions in translational research. Coupled with the advancements in genetic manipulation technologies during the past decade, knockout rats have become versatile, adaptable animal models to study, offering scientists invaluable knowledge in particular areas of rat and human physiology.

The most efficient knockout rat models focus on a specific disease or feature a particular gene inactivation. That gene will be knocked out in the rat’s genome, while scientists will study the resulting behaviors and disorders as closely as possible. During an experiment, scientists will explore treatments and invent new methods of counteracting any adverse effects – or even go straight to the core of the problem by using gene therapies. The result is that knockout rat models have become some of the most essential and widely used animal models nowadays. Whether studying mutations or how a gene is linked to certain diseases, genetic scientists now possess a powerful tool in knockout rats.

Using knockout rats, researchers have achieved many breakthroughs that might not have been previously possible with mouse models. So, in answering the question, “what is a knockout rat and why is it an important research tool,” scientists are now able use these rodents to reach more accurate conclusions and find treatments for diseases more efficiently. These animal models give researchers the ability to gather important information about the rat genome and the roles those genes play, not only in regulating physiological processes throughout the body, but also in inducing or eliminating certain disorders.

The genetic origins often attributed to the onset of certain diseases have been a topic of debate among scientists for a long time. Today, with the help of knockout rat models, researchers can follow the onset, progression, and consequences of a variety of diseases, throughout generations of these animal models. This is for the purpose of finding cures and treatments that can then be adapted for treatment in humans.
