# Meet ingenious Scientist Kristen Coughlin

![ingenious Scientist Introduction: Kristen Coughlin](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/665dc660af52559c0ed6ec8b/667b222d02a0f61178bcfab0_ingenious-Scientist-Introduction-Kristen-Coughlin-680x378.jpeg)
Kristen has been with ingenious since 2004 and has held roles in Sales, Marketing, Business Development and Scientific Project Management. She completed her graduate work in molecular genetics and microbiology at Stony Brook University where she studied viral protein trafficking in host cells. At ingenious, Kristen brings her science and business knowledge together to inform product development, improve operations, and provide project information to clients. Being a mother of two very active little boys as well, Kristen leans on mindfulness and mediation practices to stay grounded.

## We’ve compiled all the articles Kristen’s written about animal models in one place:

1) [2018 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine](/newsletters/2018-nobel-prize-in-physiology-or-medicine/)The 2018 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine goes to Dr.’s James P. Allison and Tasuku Honjo for their contribution to cancer therapy. With the help of research in mice, this treatment, called immune checkpoint therapy, is now applied to humans.

2) [Why Make A Humanized Mouse?](/ingenious-blog/why-make-a-humanized-mouse)“Humanized” mice have been used more frequently in research because they are formidable models of the human being. But what exactly is a humanized mouse, and why do scientists make them to more accurately study disease? [Read more](/ingenious-blog/why-make-a-humanized-mouse)

3) [3 Things I Wish I Knew Before Making My First Knockin Mouse Model](/mouse-models/3-things-i-wish-i-knew-before-making-my-first-knockin-mouse-model/)You might be wondering if you can continue your research using a pre-existing mouse model, or if you’ll ever graduate if you decide to take on a custom mouse model project. These are 3 things you should know before you get started on a new knockin mouse model. [Read more](/mouse-models/3-things-i-wish-i-knew-before-making-my-first-knockin-mouse-model/)

4) [Gaining Inducible Control of Your Tissue-Specific Animal Model](/ingenious-blog/gaining-inducible-control)Because the Cre-lox system is straightforward and reliable, there are numerous Cre lines that you can use for your research. If you’re looking for more than just tissue-specific control, though, we’ve outlined two inducible systems that can provide temporal control for your animal model.

5) [Understanding Rat Models Of Various Human Disease](/rat-models/understanding-rat-models-of-varied-human-disease/)For modeling human disease, there are certain studies where rat models are preferred over mouse models. Because rats have been used in research for over a century, the scientific community has extensive phenotypic and physiological knowledge about these models.

6) [The Advantages Of Rat Models](/ingenious-blog/the-advantages-of-rat-models)Many labs choose to work with rats because their larger size makes handling, sampling, and other procedures much easier. In addition, they’re well-suited for studies in behavior, physiology, toxicology, and learning. Discover all the advantages of rat models for different types of research.

7) [What Is The Mouse Knockout Timeline?](/newsletters/mouse-knockout-timeline/)If you plan on working with knockout mice for your next study, then it’s important that you know the timeline for generating these models. Depending on whether you use gene targeting in ES cells or gene editing using CRISPR technology, the total time from start to finish can vary. [Read more](/newsletters/mouse-knockout-timeline/)
