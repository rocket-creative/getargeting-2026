    metaDescription: "Explore how point mutations alter gene function, drive disease, and power preclinical discovery. Learn how engineered point mutation mice advance biomedical research.",
    introduction: "Despite their small scale, point mutations are among the most powerful tools in genetics and biomedical research. They occur when one nucleotide—adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), or thymine (T)—is substituted, inserted, or deleted within a DNA sequence. Such changes can have minimal impact (as in silent mutations) or severe consequences, such as loss of gene function, altered protein structure, or disease initiation.",
    sections: [
      {
        title: "Types of Point Mutations",
        content: "Point mutations include substitution mutations (silent, missense, nonsense), insertion and deletion (indel) mutations that can cause frameshifts, and regulatory mutations in promoters, enhancers, or splice sites that affect gene expression without changing the protein sequence."
      },
      {
        title: "Functional Consequences",
        content: "Point mutations can cause loss-of-function (reduced or abolished protein activity), gain-of-function (new or enhanced activity), dominant-negative effects (mutant interferes with wild-type), or conditional effects that manifest only under certain conditions."
      },
      {
        title: "Research Applications",
        content: "Point mutation mouse models are vital for disease modeling, protein function analysis, regulatory element studies, therapeutic development and validation, and precision medicine/pharmacogenomics research."

    ],
    faqs: [
      {
        question: "How does a point mutation differ from a larger genetic alteration?",
        answer: "A point mutation alters only one nucleotide, whereas larger alterations involve substantial DNA insertions, deletions, or rearrangements. Despite their small size, point mutations can produce dramatic biological effects."
      },
      {
        question: "Are all point mutations harmful?",
        answer: "No. Many point mutations are neutral or silent, having no observable effect. Others can be beneficial, deleterious, or context-dependent depending on the gene, location, and environmental conditions."

    metaDescription: "Explore how missense and nonsense mutations alter gene function, drive disease, and power preclinical research. Learn their molecular consequences and applications in engineered mouse models.",
    introduction: "Not all point mutations are created equal. Even a single base substitution can profoundly alter how a protein is built—changing its structure, activity, stability, or localization. Missense mutations lead to a single amino acid change, while nonsense mutations create a premature stop codon, truncating translation and often destroying protein activity altogether.",
    faqs: [
      {
        question: "Which is more severe—a missense or a nonsense mutation?",
        answer: "It depends on context. Nonsense mutations usually result in truncated, nonfunctional proteins, but a single missense mutation in a crucial domain can be equally damaging or even more pathogenic."
      },
      {
        question: "Can nonsense mutations be treated?",
        answer: "Some nonsense mutations respond to readthrough therapies, which allow ribosomes to bypass premature stop codons and produce full-length proteins."

  "frameshift-mutation": {
    metaTitle: "Frameshift Mutation | Mechanism, Disease Impact, and Mouse Model Applications",
    metaDescription: "Learn how frameshift mutations disrupt protein coding, contribute to human disease, and power functional genomics in engineered mouse models.",
    introduction: "The genetic code is read in triplets—groups of three nucleotides called codons—each specifying a single amino acid. The reading frame is therefore essential for translating a gene into a functional protein. When insertions or deletions occur in multiples not divisible by three, the reading frame shifts, altering every downstream codon.",
    faqs: [
      {
        question: "Are frameshift mutations always harmful?",
        answer: "Most frameshift mutations are highly deleterious, resulting in truncated or nonfunctional proteins. In rare cases, they can produce novel functional outcomes."
      },
      {
        question: "How do frameshift mutations differ from nonsense mutations?",
        answer: "Nonsense mutations introduce a premature stop codon but preserve the upstream sequence. Frameshift mutations alter the downstream reading frame, usually leading to more severe disruptions in protein function."

    metaDescription: "Understand how gain-of-function and loss-of-function mutations in mice shape gene activity, drive disease, and guide therapeutic development.",
    introduction: "Genetic mutations can influence how a protein behaves in a cell—not just whether it is present, but how much of it is produced, how active it is, or what it does. Gain-of-function mutations enhance normal activity or create new functions, while loss-of-function mutations reduce or eliminate normal gene product function.",
    faqs: [
      {
        question: "Can the same mutation be both gain- and loss-of-function?",
        answer: "Not the same mutation, but different mutations in the same gene can have opposite effects—one increasing protein activity, another eliminating it."
      },
      {
        question: "How do researchers determine if a mutation is gain-of-function or loss-of-function?",
        answer: "Researchers use biochemical assays, signaling readouts, and phenotype characterization in cell or mouse models to assess whether a mutation increases, reduces, or abolishes function."

    introduction: "At the heart of every genetic experiment—from basic Mendelian crosses to advanced preclinical mouse modeling—lie three foundational concepts: allele, genotype, and phenotype. These terms describe different layers of biological information: the sequence variants that define genes (alleles), the combinations of those variants in an organism (genotype), and the observable traits that result (phenotype).",
    faqs: [
      {
        question: "Does genotype always predict phenotype?",

    introduction: "Promoters, enhancers, and other regulatory elements are non-coding DNA sequences that control when, where, and how genes are expressed. They function as molecular switches that coordinate transcriptional activity by interacting with transcription factors, chromatin modifiers, and the basal transcription machinery.",
    faqs: [
      {
        question: "What is the difference between a promoter and an enhancer?",
        answer: "Promoters are proximal regulatory regions located immediately upstream of a gene's transcription start site that initiate transcription. Enhancers are distal elements that can be thousands of base pairs away and function independently of position to increase transcription."

    metaDescription: "Discover how open reading frames (ORFs) define protein-coding genes, ensure correct translation, and influence transgene design in genetically engineered mouse models.",
    introduction: "An open reading frame (ORF) is a continuous stretch of DNA or RNA sequence that can be translated into a protein. It begins with a start codon (typically AUG in mRNA) and ends with a stop codon (UAA, UAG, or UGA). ORFs represent the protein-coding potential of a gene and define the framework through which genetic information is converted into functional polypeptides.",
    faqs: [
      {
        question: "Why is maintaining the ORF important in gene targeting?",

It allows for accurate correction or insertion of DNA sequences at defined genomic loci, preserving reading frames and regulatory integrity.",
    faqs: [
      {
        question: "How does homologous recombination differ from NHEJ?",

    introduction: "Non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) is a DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair pathway that directly ligates broken DNA ends without requiring a homologous template. It is an efficient but error-prone mechanism that can introduce small insertions or deletions (indels), making it a fundamental process for both natural DNA repair and targeted genome modification.",
    faqs: [
      {
        question: "When is NHEJ preferred over homologous recombination?",
        answer: "NHEJ is preferred when high precision is not essential and rapid model generation is needed. It does not require donor templates and creates gene knockouts via small insertions or deletions."

    metaDescription: "Learn how genetic mosaicism occurs in engineered mice, how it affects phenotype consistency, and why breeding and validation are essential for achieving germline transmission.",
    introduction: "Mosaicism refers to the presence of two or more genetically distinct cell populations within the same organism that originated from a single fertilized egg. In genetic engineering, mosaicism arises when not all cells carry the intended genetic modification, resulting in a mixture of modified and unmodified genotypes across tissues or developmental stages.",
    faqs: [
      {
        question: "How does mosaicism affect mouse model quality?",
