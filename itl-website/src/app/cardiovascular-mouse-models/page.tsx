// FAQ Data
const faqData = [
  {
    question: "What Cre drivers are used for cardiovascular research?",
    answer: "Common cardiovascular Cre drivers include Myh6-Cre (cardiomyocytes), Tie2-Cre (endothelial cells), SM22-Cre (smooth muscle cells), and alphaMHC-CreERT2 (inducible cardiomyocyte). Selection depends on whether you're studying cardiac, vascular, or combined cardiovascular phenotypes."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I study atherosclerosis with genetically engineered models?",
    answer: "Yes. Atherosclerosis models typically combine conditional gene modifications with hyperlipidemic backgrounds (ApoE knockout or LDLR knockout). For example, macrophage-specific knockouts on ApoE-/- background enable study of how specific genes affect plaque formation and inflammation."
  },
  {
    question: "What cardiovascular phenotyping assays are available?",
    answer: "Standard assays include echocardiography (cardiac function), blood pressure measurement (tail cuff or telemetry), exercise testing (treadmill), and vascular function (wire myography). More specialized assays include cardiac MRI, pressure-volume loops, and isolated heart perfusion."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I model heart failure in mice?",
    answer: "Heart failure models can involve cardiomyocyte-specific knockouts of contractile proteins, inducible cardiac gene deletion in adults, or pressure overload (TAC surgery). Conditional systems enable temporal control to avoid developmental defects while studying adult cardiac function."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the advantage of inducible cardiac models?",
    answer: "Tamoxifen-inducible Cre systems (e.g., alphaMHC-CreERT2) enable gene deletion in adult cardiomyocytes after normal development is complete. This avoids developmental compensation and allows study of acute gene loss effects on adult cardiac function, better modeling acquired heart disease."
