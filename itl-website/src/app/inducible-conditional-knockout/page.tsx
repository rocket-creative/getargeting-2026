// Hero Data
const heroData = {
  badge: "Inducible Gene Targeting",
  title: "Inducible Conditional Knockout",
  intro: "Since 1998, Ingenious Targeting Laboratory has completed over 2,500 custom gene targeting projects, including conditional alleles compatible with inducible Cre systems. Our knockout models have supported research published in more than 800 peer reviewed articles, including in Science, Nature and Cell.",
  description: "Inducible conditional knockout combines the tissue specificity of conditional gene targeting with temporal control over when deletion occurs. By using tamoxifen inducible CreERT2 or doxycycline regulated systems, researchers can trigger gene deletion at any point in development or adult life, enabling study of gene function independent of developmental requirements and modeling acute versus chronic loss of function phenotypes."

// Two Component System Data
const twoComponentData = {
  title: "How Inducible Systems Work",
  subtitle: "The Two Component System",
  intro: "Inducible conditional knockout requires two genetic components working together:",
  components: [
    {
      title: "Floxed (Conditional) Allele",
      description: "The target gene contains loxP sites flanking critical exons. The floxed allele functions normally until exposed to Cre recombinase. Ingenious Targeting Laboratory can generate these conditional alleles specific to your research."
    },
    {
      title: "Inducible Cre Driver",
      description: "A transgenic or knockin line expressing an inducible form of Cre recombinase. Cre activity is suppressed until an inducing agent (tamoxifen or doxycycline) is administered. There are repositories that offer these inducible lines. However, if you need a specialized inducible Cre driver, Ingenious Targeting Laboratory has the expertise to produce these for you too."
    }
  ],
  note: "When both components are combined in the same animal, gene deletion can be triggered at the time of the investigator's choosing by administering the inducing agent."
};

// CreERT2 System Data
const creERT2Data = {
  title: "Tamoxifen Inducible (CreERT2) System",
  intro: "CreERT2 is the most widely used inducible Cre system. It consists of Cre recombinase fused to a modified estrogen receptor ligand binding domain:",
  steps: [
    "In the absence of tamoxifen, CreERT2 is sequestered in the cytoplasm",
    "Tamoxifen (or its metabolite 4 hydroxytamoxifen) binds the modified estrogen receptor",
    "Ligand binding triggers nuclear translocation of CreERT2",
    "Nuclear Cre catalyzes recombination between loxP sites",
    "Gene deletion is permanent once recombination occurs"
  ],
  note: "Recombination typically occurs within days of tamoxifen administration, with maximal deletion achieved by 1 to 2 weeks post treatment depending on dosing regimen."
};

// Ubiquitous Cre Drivers Data

// When to Use Data
const whenToUseData = {
  title: "When to Use Inducible Systems",
  useCases: [
    {
      title: "Bypassing Developmental Lethality",
      description: "Many genes are essential for embryonic development. Conventional knockout is lethal, and even tissue specific conditional knockout may cause developmental defects if deletion occurs during organogenesis. Inducible systems enable gene deletion after development is complete, allowing study of adult gene function."
    },
    {
      title: "Distinguishing Developmental from Adult Roles",
      description: "Genes may have distinct functions during development versus adulthood. Constitutive deletion conflates these roles. Inducible deletion in adults reveals the gene's ongoing function independent of its developmental requirements.",
      example: "A gene required for neuronal migration during development may also regulate synaptic plasticity in adults. Inducible knockout allows study of the adult synaptic function without the confounding effects of abnormal neuronal positioning."
    },
    {
      title: "Modeling Drug Target Inhibition",
      description: "Inducible knockout most closely models therapeutic target inhibition: Patient has normal target function before treatment, drug administration causes acute target inhibition. Inducible knockout mirrors this: normal function until tamoxifen triggers deletion.",
      note: "This makes inducible systems valuable for drug target validation, predicting consequences of pharmacological inhibition rather than lifelong gene absence."
    },
    {
      title: "Studying Acute vs Chronic Phenotypes",
      description: "Constitutive knockouts represent chronic, lifelong gene loss. Inducible knockouts enable study of acute effects immediately following gene deletion, as well as progression of phenotypes over time. This temporal resolution is valuable for understanding disease mechanisms and therapeutic windows."
    },
    {
      title: "Avoiding Developmental Compensation",
      description: "When genes are deleted early in development, compensatory mechanisms may mask the full phenotype. Related genes may upregulate, alternative pathways may activate. Deleting genes in adults, after these developmental adaptations have occurred, can reveal stronger or different phenotypes."
    }

// FAQ Data
const faqData = [
  {
    question: "What is the difference between inducible conditional knockout and regular conditional knockout?",
    answer: "Inducible conditional knockout uses tamoxifen-inducible Cre (CreER) to enable temporal control of gene deletion. Regular conditional knockout uses constitutive Cre drivers that delete genes during development. Inducible systems allow adult-onset deletion, avoiding developmental effects and enabling study of acute gene function."
  },
  {
    question: "When should I use inducible knockout instead of constitutive conditional knockout?",
    answer: "Use inducible knockout when genes are essential for development (would cause lethality if deleted early), when you need to study acute vs chronic phenotypes, when modeling drug target inhibition (requires adult-onset deletion), or when avoiding developmental compensation is important for revealing true gene function."
  },
  {
    question: "How is tamoxifen administered for inducible knockout?",
    answer: "Tamoxifen is typically administered via IP injection (75-100 mg/kg for 3-5 days), oral gavage (100-200 mg/kg for 3-5 days), or tamoxifen diet (400 mg/kg chow for 1-4 weeks). IP injection and oral gavage provide rapid, high-efficiency recombination. Diet provides more convenient long-term administration."
  },
  {
    question: "What controls are needed for inducible knockout experiments?",
    answer: "Essential controls include Cre-positive, flox-negative mice (to detect Cre toxicity), flox-positive, Cre-negative mice (to detect tamoxifen effects), and vehicle-treated controls (to detect tamoxifen-specific effects). Reporter crosses (Rosa26-tdTomato) validate recombination efficiency in your specific system."
