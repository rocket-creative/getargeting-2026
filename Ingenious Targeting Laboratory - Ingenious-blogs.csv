While introducing and establishing gene expression constructs in cells may be more straightforward and can be less rigorous in methodology or approach, transgenic animal model production involves some deeper planning and considerations.</p><p id="""">With transgenic animal production, model design features relating to the transgenic construct components, integration of the transgenic construct into the genome, and copy number of the transgene become significant considerations that may impact the utility of the animal model and your research in the years to come.</p><p id="""">Creating transgenic mice comes down to two types of methodologies: random genomic insertion of the transgene, or specific targeted insertion of the transgene.</p><p id="""">While the timeline to producing mice via random transgenic insertion may be shorter, each mouse produced is an independent “founder” which must be genotyped and phenotyped for proper insertion and expression of the transgene. Targeted transgenic insertion involves a longer timeline for mouse production, providing the benefits of reliability, predictability, and robustness. So which is the better option to go with?</p><p id="""">As a quick guide for planning your next transgenic mouse model, below are 4 distinguishing reasons that can help you determine whether a targeted transgenic model is necessary.</p><h3 id="""">1. <strong id="""">Know thy gene:</strong> Achieve defined transgene integration into a specific “safe harbor” locus.</h3><p id="""">While random insertion transgenesis may land your transgenic construct anywhere in the mouse genome, a targeted transgenic knockin is designed to insert your construct into one specific location, typically a transcriptionally active “safe harbor” locus such as ROSA26. Genomic locations that are undesirable for transgene integration include genes (resulting in knockout of the interrupted gene) and heterochromatin regions. A safe harbor locus is a specific genomic location that has been validated to be transcriptionally active and permissive for expression of transgenic constructs. Mouse ROSA26 locus is one of the most commonly used insertion sites for creating targeted transgenic knockin mice.</p><h3 id="""">2. <strong id="""">Keep it whole:</strong> Ensure your entire transgenic construct is integrated.</h3><p id="""">Random transgenic integration tends to involve transgenic construct breakage before the integration, as well as transgene concatemerization (multiple attached copies of the transgene inserted together). Targeted transgenic insertion is the optimal methodology for achieving intact, single-copy transgene integration. Additionally, by using mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells in targeted transgenic mice production, the targeted ES cells can be screened for proper integration of the construct prior to generating the mice, which is more robust and higher throughput compared to screening mice.</p><h3 id="""">3. <strong id="""">Choose a good community:</strong> Make sure your transgene will be expressed.</h3><p id="""">ROSA26 is a transcriptionally active locus that has been used to create over 700 targeted transgenic mouse models, as shown in Mouse Genome Informatics. Transgene expression options include using endogenous ROSA26 gene promoter or adding an exogenous promoter into the construct, such as the artificial compound CAG promoter. A conditional expression design is commonly achieved by placing a STOP cassette between the promoter and the cDNA, and the STOP cassette is typically flanked with loxP sites for cassette removal by Cre-lox recombination.</p><h3 id="""">4. <strong id="""">Stability is key:</strong> Keep hold of your transgene.</h3><p id="""">Specific targeting of your transgenic construct into ROSA26 locus means knowing that your transgene will be there generation after generation. Randomly inserted trangenes may be unstable over time, leading to changes in expression and changes in copy number. The variability of random insertion allows transgene integration into genomic regions that may be less stable, and transgene concatemers at an insertion site may also change with time.</p><p>‍</p>",

The same transgenic knockin strategies used to make such lines can also be used for tissue-specific expression of almost any gene. For example, lines for controlled expression of a mutant gene sequence can be created using transgenic knockin approaches. Several methods, described below, are available to investigators.</p><h3 id="""">Random Integration</h3><p id="""">Transgenic knockin techniques for mice went through a period of rapid development in the early 1980s. A common approach starts with the creation of a genetic construct with regulatory and coding sequences, for example a promoter element next to the sequence for a reporter gene. This would be randomly integrated into the mouse genome by injecting linear DNA molecules into fertilized eggs, a method still used today. The injected DNA can be a small artificial expression construct or a long sequence from the human genome, or anything in between. In many cases this method will create a new mouse model with the coding sequence expressed in specific tissues of interest. However multiple integration events must be tested when using this approach since random integration can produce unpredictable results on transgene expression. These varying outcomes result from the random nature of the technique, with the transgene’s expression possibly being affected by the chromosomal region where it integrates.</p><h3 id="""">Targeted Transgenic Knockin</h3><p id="""">The strategy of a small promoter sequence driving tissue-specific expression can be improved by using targeted rather than random genomic integration. The Rosa26 locus on chromosome 6 was originally identified as a site where an inserted gene would be ubiquitously expressed during development, and the mouse would suffer no ill effects from the genomic change. The lab of Philippe Soriano identified the locus and demonstrated that it could be specifically targeted to create new transgenic lines without the drawbacks of random transgene integration. Transgenes inserted at the Rosa26 locus are efficiently passed on to the next generation, and each mouse will have an identical level and pattern of expression. Creating a targeted transgenic knockin line initially requires more work and time than simply injecting DNA into fertilized eggs. This is compensated for by the consistent results – only one founder is needed and extensive screening of expression in pups is not necessary.</p><h3 id="""">Knockin at Endogenous Locus</h3><p id="""">Another common strategy for obtaining tissue-specific expression in genetically engineered mouse models is knocking in a new sequence so it replaces an endogenous gene. This strategy is preferable for creating reporter lines that most faithfully duplicate the expression pattern of a specific gene. In principle almost any sequence can be used for the knockin, for example a coding sequence incorporating mutations or the coding sequence of a human gene. Often lines made with this method result in disruption of the targeted gene but co-expression of two genes is possible if the right design is used.

In parallel, they have been repurposing currently available antiviral drugs to aid in recovery while developing new therapies and vaccines against coronavirus disease 2019, or COVID-19.</p><p id="""">SARS-CoV-2 is a beta-coronavirus closely related to SARS-CoV, the virus that caused a smaller global outbreak in the early 2000s. As with SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 binds the human ACE2 receptor on epithelial cells. Serine proteases such as TMPRSS2 are required for entry into the cell, facilitated by endocytosis.</p><p id="""">SARS-CoV-2 binds with greater affinity to human ACE2 than does SARS-CoV, likely contributing to the higher infectivity of SARS-Cov-2. The infection begins with an incubation period of about 5 days, with illness typically developing by 11 days. It is in the early phase that symptoms are mild and mostly confined to the upper respiratory tract, with most people remaining asymptomatic, although there is still the capability of transmitting infection. When symptoms do begin, they tend to be typical of viral respiratory illness and can include fever, cough, and fatigue. Approximately 80% of people will remain with mild symptoms and the disease will not extend to the lower respiratory tract. However, in about 20% of cases, patients develop more severe symptoms which can include pneumonia, severe gas exchange problems, acute lung injury and progress onto acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).</p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image "" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""""><a href=""https://genetargeting.com/humanized-ace2-mouse/"" target=""_blank""><div id=""""><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/665dc660af52559c0ed6ec8b/667b97264e1cb7d65e2e55dc_COVID-19-Large-Scale-Humanized-Order-CTA.jpeg"" alt=""COVID-19 Large Scale Humanized ACE2 Mouse"" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto"" id=""""></div></a></figure><p id="""">When COVID-19 first hit, many people were not too fearful because the initial statements were that it was not deadly unless you met certain criteria: being an older individual, being of a certain blood type, gender or ethnicity, or having a chronic illness. However as people communicated their experiences on social media, it became apparent that death was not limited to a certain defined group, and that people much younger, with no chronic conditions and that were perfectly healthy individuals were dying from COVID-19. It became very real very fast and within one year, there have been over 140 million cases and 3 million deaths from COVID-19. In addition to the death toll, we are now learning about long-term effects from those who survived COVID-19, who will have lifelong complications from the viral infection. With new variants on the rise as well as disparities in treatment capabilities around the world, it has become even more important to develop better therapies and vaccines. Preclinical animal models play a vital role in this endeavor.</p><h3 id="""">Advantages of using ACE2 transgenic mice</h3><p id="""">A wide spectrum of laboratory and domestic animal species have been challenged with SARS-CoV-2 in an effort to find suitable preclinical models for studying COVID-19, but only a few, such as hamsters, cats, ferrets and monkeys, are susceptible to the virus. Unfortunately, many of these species are neither accessible nor practical for the vast majority of researchers to make progress rapidly enough to help the global pandemic.<br>When it comes to preclinical models in general, mice constitute about 70% of all the laboratory animal species used in biomedical research. The advantage of their small size and short life cycle makes them easier to work with and maintain, and their anatomical, physiological, and genetic similarity to humans make them a top choice for researching human disease. However, SARS-CoV-2 does not infect mice the same way it does humans and does not lead to significant disease in mice as seen in humans. Luckily, there is a wealth of genetic tools that are available for modifying the mouse to express human ACE2, offering researchers a unique opportunity to create versatile preclinical tools for COVID-19 research that are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p><h3 id="""">How to generate ACE2 transgenic mice</h3><p id="""">In order to generate ACE2 transgenic mice, the human ACE2 gene (hACE2) is placed under the control of a promoter of choice in order to induce expression of hACE2 in a specific tissue or cell type in the mouse. These strains are readily susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and are invaluable tools for studies on pathogenesis and antiviral therapies for COVID-19.</p><p id="""">For example, one ACE2 transgenic mouse line used the human cytokeratin 18 (K18) promoter to express a full-length hACE2 cDNA in epithelial cells. The transgene was injected into pronuclei of fertilized mouse eggs to generate transgenic embryos, which were then implanted into surrogate mother mice and the progenies were studied. It was shown that K18 directed expression of human ACE2 in the lung, colon, liver, and kidney of the transgenic offspring. Three to five days following the SARS-Cov infection, the ACE2 transgenic mice began to lose weight and become lethargic with labored breathing. Within seven days, all the transgenic mice in the original study died, supporting that transgenic expression of hACE2 in epithelial cells can lead to a moderate SARS-CoV infection that can progress into a fatal disease.</p><h4 id="""">Infecting mice with SARS-CoV-2</h4><p id="""">Standard infection of ACE2 transgenic mice is via intranasal inoculation of SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2. A recent study showed that infection with SARS-CoV-2 in the ACE2 transgenic mice resulted in high levels of viral infection in lungs, with spread to other organs. A decline in lung function occurred several days after peak viral titer and correlated with the infiltration of immune cells. SARS-CoV-2-infected lung tissues showed a massively upregulated innate immune response similar to what is seen in humans. Thus, the ACE2 transgenic mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection is one model that can be used to study lung disease and test immune and antiviral-based therapies.</p><h4 id="""">The future of using mouse models to study COVID-19</h4><p id="""">Although ACE2 transgenic mice have been promising for COVID-19 research, they lack some of the tissue-specificity seen in humans and might not replicate COVID-19 precisely, limiting their applications in certain studies. Therefore, precise genetic editing to express human ACE2 specifically at the mouse ACE2 locus in order to observe an endogenous pattern of expression and an infection that progresses similar to what is seen in humans is imperative.</p><p id="""">Many research labs and commercial companies are working toward using gene targeting and editing to make specifically-targeted human ACE2 mouse models, including <strong id="""">ingenious targeting laboratory</strong>. We have developed our own exclusive, large-scale humanized mouse model that provides a targeted, hybrid human/mouse ACE2 receptor which supports viral infection of a human host while conserving intracellular signaling functionality of the mouse. It is our hope that our model will enable relevant studies of infectivity, viral life cycle, and disease progression by means of a new, virally-susceptible murine experimental platform that can be used to develop better therapies and vaccines.</p><p id=""""><a href=""https://genetargeting.com/humanized-ace2-mouse/"" id=""""><strong id="""">Click here</strong></a> to learn more about our ACE2 mouse model or to place an order.</p><h4 id=""""><em id="""">References</em></h4><ul id=""""><li id="""">Gurumurthy CB, Quadros RM, Richardson GP, Poluektova LY, Mansour SL, Ohtsuka M. 2020. <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33106680/"" target=""_blank"" id="""">Genetically modified mouse models to help fight COVID-19</a>. <em id="""">Nat Protoc</em> <strong id="""">15</strong>(12): 3777-3787.</li><li id="""">Liu FL, Wu K, Sun J, Duan Z, Quan X, Kuang J, Chu S, Pang W, Gao H, Xu L, Li YC, Zhang HL, Wang XH, Luo RH, Feng XL, Schöler HR, Chen X, Pei D, Wu G, Zheng YT, Chen J. 2020. <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7717373/"" target=""_blank"" id="""">Rapid generation of ACE2 humanized inbred mouse model for COVID-19 with tetraploid complementation</a>. <em id="""">Natl Sci Rev</em>.</li><li id="""">Johansen MD, Irving A, Montagutelli X, Tate MD, Rudloff I, Nold MF, Hansbro NG, Kim RY, Donovan C, Liu G, Faiz A, Short KR, Lyons JG, McCaughan GW, Gorrell MD, Cole A, Moreno C, Couteur D, Hesselson D, Triccas J, Neely GG, Gamble JR, Simpson SJ, Saunders BM, Oliver BG, Britton WJ, Wark PA, Nold-Petry CA, Hansbro PM. 2020. <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32820248/"" target=""_blank"" id="""">Animal and translational models of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19</a>. <em id="""">Mucosal Immunol</em> <strong id="""">13</strong>(6): 877-891.</li><li id="""">Winkler ES, Bailey AL, Kafai NM, Nair S, McCune BT, Yu J, Fox JM, Chen RE, Earnest JT, Keeler SP, Ritter JH, Kang LI, Dort S, Robichaud A, Head R, Holtzman MJ, Diamond MS. 2020. <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32839612/"" target=""_blank"" id="""">SARS-CoV-2 infection of human ACE2-transgenic mice causes severe lung inflammation and impaired function</a>. <em id="""">Nat Immunol</em> <strong id="""">21</strong>(11): 1327-1335.</li><li id="""">Jia H, Yue X, Lazartigues E. 2020. <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33057007/"" target=""_blank"" id="""">ACE2 mouse models: a toolbox for cardiovascular and pulmonary research</a>. <em id="""">Nat Commun</em> <strong id="""">11</strong>(1): 5165.</li><li id=""""><a href=""https://www.jax.org/news-and-insights/2020/february/introducing-mouse-model-for-corona-virus"" target=""_blank"" id="""">hACE2 transgenic mouse model for coronavirus (COVID-19) research – The Jackson Laboratory</a></li></ul><p id="""">‍</p>",

Understanding the potential of these mouse models can help you choose the right one for your next research project. So let’s take a closer look at exactly what BACs are, how they’re used to create animal models, and a few examples of where these models are used.</p><h3 id="""">What Are BACs in the First Place?</h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">BACs (bacterial artificial chromosomes) are DNA molecules with specific properties that make them useful in a number of ways.</strong> They were originally developed to address a specific problem encountered by researchers trying to understand how genes function. Scientists wanted to study genetic sequences of 100,000 base pairs or more but they couldn’t easily manipulate DNA molecules that large. A BAC can contain a genetic sequence of up to 300,000 base pairs and the development of this technology opened up multiple new research possibilities.</p><h3 id="""">BACs and Transgenic Mice – Modeling Genetic Diseases</h3><p id="""">Mouse models are widely used around the world to study genetically inherited diseases, with the goals of understanding, treating, and one day curing them. Animal research can be a vital part of a project to understand a human condition and BACs can be used to create a specific, valuable type of animal model: the BAC transgenic. A BAC can contain the entire sequence of a human gene, such as one that’s associated with a particular genetic disease. This gene sequence can be permanently integrated into the genetic makeup of a mouse. Using these transgenic mice makes it possible to observe how the gene functions in vivo, and potentially understand its relationship with a genetic disease.</p><p id="""">However, the use of BACs to generate transgenic mice is still accompanied by several problems. BAC transgenes are generated by nonspecific integration into the target genome; therefore a variable number of copies can be inserted into an unknown locus in the genome of the target organism. Also, the generation of BAC transgenic founders is less efficient than conventional transgenes; it usually results in less founder lines being generated in the course of a similar microinjection effort. These issues can be potentially avoided by generating <a href=""https://genetargeting.com/transgenic-mouse-models/"" id=""""><strong id="""">targeted transgenic mice</strong></a>, through either a cDNA knockin to your gene of interest or a safe-harbor transgenic knockin.</p><h3 id="""">BAC Mice and Neuroscience</h3><p id="""">Bacterial artificial chromosomes can contain genetic sequences that are known to be associated with conditions such as neurological disorders. For example, a scientific study may identify a gene mutation that could make people more prone to seizures. A BAC containing the mutated gene sequence could be used to successfully generate a BAC transgenic mouse. Researchers have used BAC animal models to better understand seizure disorders in humans, with the goal of developing new treatments for these conditions.</p><p>‍</p>",

The method has many advantages including over two decades of proven success in mouse models and the ability to enable otherwise-impossible experiments. A common application of Cre-lox in mice is the conditional knockout model which is a perfect example of the system’s advantages.</p><p id="""">The name conditional knockout refers to the inactivation of a target gene specifically in cells where certain conditions are met. To use conditional knockout in an experiment, two different genetically modified mouse strains are crossed together producing offspring carrying both modifications. One of the parents is altered so the viral protein Cre is produced in specific cells. The other has had one of its genes floxed which means two small loxP genetic elements have been added to the target gene. Conditional knockout occurs in offspring that express Cre and also have the floxed gene. Wherever Cre is active part of that gene is deleted and the remaining portion is inactivated, or knocked out.</p><p id="""">Experiments using these mouse models can test a wide variety of hypotheses because the system requires two elements to function: Cre protein and a floxed gene. Each element is provided by a separate genetic modification so the possible combinations are almost limitless. For example, a new strain of mice could be generated by floxing the gene of a particular ion channel. That floxed line could then be used in conjunction with any of the hundreds of Cre-expressing lines that already exist. It would be possible to study the effects of knocking out that ion channel throughout the brain or only in specific kinds of neurons, depending on where Cre is active. If a Cre line with the desired expression pattern doesn’t already exist it’s straightforward to create one, and the new Cre line can be used with many floxed lines.</p><p id="""">A major advantage of conditional knockout models is the possibility of delaying gene knockout until later stages of embryonic development or even after birth. This is due to the high likelihood that a gene will have one function in the embryo and another in a mature animal. It’s common for a gene to be essential in embryos such that development can not proceed if the gene is inactivated. Conditional knockouts avoid this problem if the gene is floxed properly with loxP sites in the right places – until Cre is active the gene will initially function as normal. The gene can be inactivated in older mice by choosing an appropriate Cre line. Conditional knockout contrasts strongly in this aspect with another common knockout strategy, constitutive knockout. In that type of model a gene is permanently disrupted in all cells at all stages of life. Such models are useful but don’t have the flexibility of conditional knockouts.</p><p id="""">Conditional knockout mice illustrate many of the advantages of the Cre-lox system such as flexibility and control. The steps for placing loxP sites in the genome to flox a target gene have been worked out over decades by researchers around the world. Cre-lox can also be used for other kinds of experiments besides conditional knockout. For example it’s possible to label specific cells by expressing a fluorescent reporter gene or to overexpress a gene of interest in a particular tissue. The possibility of incorporating Cre-lox should always be evaluated if mice are part of future research plans.</p><p id="""">‍</p>",

These types of mice are responsible for the study of genes that, if mutated or inactivated, can lead to severe physiological changes and diseases that can even be fatal. Due to the similarities between the mouse genome and the human genome, there are numerous transgenic mouse models available today. Many of them can be used together with floxed models to generate the right type of conditional knockout for a certain study. Cre floxed mice can be extremely helpful in assisting scientists to not only to determine exactly what the role of a gene is and what went wrong when it was deactivated, but also in discovering new and improved treatments and drugs that could benefit countless lives in the near future.</p><h2 id="""">Why Are Floxed Mice so Important?</h2><p id="""">Floxed mice are important because they can be generated as mouse models of a disease by conditionally eliminating a specific gene through the use of the Cre lox recombination system. What happens is that the gene in question is flanked by recombinant sites, such as loxP sites, which are then targeted through the Cre lox method to achieve a knockout. The mice then grow from embryo stage to adulthood, and can help scientists study the progression of the various diseases resulting from the knockout in vivo, and without the need to observe the same process in a live human subject. Other recombinant sites that can be used are FLP-FRT or Dre recombinase, which like Cre, are both highly efficient site specific recombinases and are frequently used in mouse-based research.</p><h2 id="""">Generating Cre Flox Knockout Mice</h2><p id="""">Generating Cre floxed mice can be done quite easily by the standards of genetic research. The most well-known method is the Cre lox recombination system, which is used to enable the Cre recombinase enzyme to catalyze the two loxP sites that flank the gene that has to be removed. Subsequently, the process can be improved and the versatility of the conditional knockouts can be greatly enhanced through the use of newly developed Cre enzymes. These enable researchers to accurately obtain conditional knockouts while saving time and achieving tissue-specific targeting.</p><h2 id="""">The Role That Flox Mice Play in Treating Cancer</h2><p id="""">Cre flox mice can be used in studying and treating many forms of cancer because cancer typically occurs when an important gene no longer functions. Such genes typically act on a certain part of the body and ensure that the cells in various tissues halt their growth after a specific amount of time to prevent the development of malignant tumors. When inactivated, these proteins are no longer there to regulate cell growth, and the result is a form of cancer specific to the tissue in question. Floxed mice can be created by targeting the gene in question and then their development can be studied, tests can be made and treatments can be tried out to see what might work best for treating the cancer or even preventing it entirely.</p><h2 id="""">The Future of Conditional Knockout Mice</h2><p id="""">Many scientists today believe that conditional knockout mice play a significant role in the study of cancer and genetic diseases, as well as the goal to promote long lasting health and prevent the effects of old age. While some of these things still sound like science fiction, Cre flox mice will lead to unlocking many new secrets of the human genome that hold numerous important discoveries.</p><p id="""">‍</p>",

This revolutionary new tool has allowed scientists to reach new levels of accuracy when it comes to making precise and targeted changes to the genome of living cells for research purposes. Whether this means taking animal testing to a new level or ensuring that stem cell research actually has a future, many goals were already reached with the help of CRISPR/Cas9, and many other – far bolder ones – have been set for the near future.</p><h3 id="""">Where Did the CRISPR Technique Come From?</h3><p id="""">Following the research of Yoshizumi Ishino and his colleagues at the Osaka University in Japan, in 1987, the accidental cloning of what would later be known as a CRISPR, resulted in a line of research that culminated with the study of interrupted, direct repeats (DR) in organisms like Haloarcula and Haloferax by Francisco Mojica at the University of Alcante in Spain. Even though Mojica’s research proved to lead to an incorrect hypothesis, a student of Mojica’s discovered further repeats in more than 20 species in the year 2000. These repeats were given the acronym CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats). The CRISPR Cas9 system was devised later using the Cas9 protein to manipulate nucleotide sequences in the guide RNA, and later, to facilitate cleavage for any target DNA sequence, allowing for simplified genome editing.</p><h3 id="""">Understanding CRISPR/Cas</h3><p id="""">Since CRISPR and associated Cas genes are used naturally by certain organisms to eliminate invading genetic material, scientists eventually confirmed this function in 2007, and went further to use CRISPR Cas methods artificially in order to facilitate guided targeted gene alterations. CRISPR Cas9 is the primary tool that was designed for this purpose. To achieve location-specific DNA recognition and cleavage, the Cas9 protein had to be put together with two types of RNA, crRNA and trRNA, which is complementary to the former. Through the resulting guide RNA, it was then possible to program the Cas9 protein to alter DNA in a specifically targeted way.</p><h3 id="""">Cas9 and CRISPR as New Tools in Molecular Biology</h3><p id="""">To date, CRISPR Cas9 has become one of the most well-known and frequently adopted genome editing methods used in molecular biology. Different variants of the Cas9 system have been developed during the past decade, and genome-editing protocols were established that would later include systems such as wild-type Cas9, which is responsible for achieving site-specific cleavage in double stranded DNA. Further advancements made possible by researcher Le Cong and his colleagues, taking the Cas9 system to a higher level of efficiency and developing the mutant form Cas9D10A, specifically designed for one-stranded DNA.</p><h3 id="""">The Advantages of Using CRISPR</h3><p id="""">The CRISPR Cas9 system has many uses and advantages that have already been recognized by the scientific community. It has already been used successfully for applications such as genome engineering with Cas9 nuclease, genome engineering through the use of double nicking methods, and localization through defective Cas9 nuclease. As for targeting efficiency, Cas9 has scored significantly high, even when compared to other well-known and popular gene editing technologies such as ZFNs or TALENs. Finally, the remarkable thing about the simplified Cas9 system is that it can and has been used successfully for a wide range of medicine and crop seed enhancement applications.</p><h3 id="""">Future Advancements with the CRISPR Technique</h3><p id="""">The future of CRISPR/Cas9 is extremely bright. Scientists are already pointing out the rapid advancements that have been made through the use of the technique, and showing that its simplicity has the potential of making it a versatile candidate for a whole range of future projects and assessments. Ultimately, in terms of its use for higher precision DNA cleavage, as well as genome editing and engineering, most experts will admit that the possibilities opened up by CRISPR Cas9 can only be limited by our ability to imagine new uses in molecular biology and genetics.</p>",

Knockout mice offer impressive insight into the inner workings of the human genome due to their genetic similarity to humans. Together with the ease and effectiveness of the CRISPR/Cas9 system, researchers are now able to accurately target single or multiple mouse genes for knockout, opening the door to new studies that could change the future of biomedical research.</p><h3 id="""">Introducing the CRISPR Gene Editing Technique</h3><p id="""">Since it’s only been available for about six years, the CRISPR Cas9 gene editing system is still considered new by many standards. CRISPR gene knockout techniques are among the most important achievements of this technology, allowing scientists to accurately target, mark and remove certain genes within a selected genome. Mice are typically used for this purpose and are generated by injection of Cas9 mRNA and single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) into mouse embryos to generate precise knockouts. The manipulation of the target cells occurs via the cell’s homologous recombination machinery. Mice that develop from these embryos are genotyped to determine if they carry the desired knockout, and those that do are bred to confirm germline transmission.</p><h3 id="""">What Are the Major Benefits of CRISPR Knockouts?</h3><p id="""">One of the main advantages of CRISPR gene knockout is that scientists now have an easier way of obtaining the models that are ideal for their research. There are various ways to introduce the knockout with gene editing. For instance, the Cas9 system is capable of targeting the mammalian genome either by the injection of a plasmid vector expressing the guide sequence along with a humanized Cas9 endonuclease, or through the co-injection of CRISPR guide RNA. The cleavage of specific genetic coding is repaired by the cell’s own internal mechanisms, leading to insertion or knockout depending on how the experiment is designed. Also, the CRISPR/Cas9 system simplifies the entire process of creating knockout mouse models, and manages to reduce the required time from 1-2 years with conventional methods, to a period of about 6 months.</p><h3 id="""">Are There Any Limitations to the CRISPR System?</h3><p id="""">The CRISPR gene knockout method is certainly not perfect. Since the molecular mechanism exploited by the DNA editing technique is mediated by the cell’s internal instructions for DNA repair, there is the possibility that additional modifications might happen. Deletions, as well as partial and multiple integration of the targeting vector could occur. Even duplication is possible in some cases. Moreover, identifying the desired allele when using the technique directly on embryos is still greatly limited, although scientists are currently working on possible alternatives and solutions to this problem.</p><h3 id="""">The Practical Performance of CRISPR Knockouts</h3><p id="""">Despite any limitations, the CRISPR gene editing technique works extremely well when used on mouse embryos. The generation of simple knockout alleles is one of the main practical capabilities of the system that scientists tend to praise the most. The system has shown great promise when it comes to the creation of specific mutations in laboratory conditions. The sensitivity and accuracy of the system has allowed scientists to create mouse models that mimic human genetic traits and disorders more accurately than before.</p><h3 id="""">Future Applications for CRISPR/Cas9</h3><p id="""">Since the development of the CRISPR gene knockout and gene editing technique in 2013, it has already made significant progress. First the technology went from single gene disruption to the ability of targeting multiple genes. Research on its use for achieving point mutations is well established, and today it’s being applied to an increasing extent for the creation of conditional knockout models. For the future, researchers have high hopes that the CRISPR technique will allow them to investigate different areas of physiology much more easily than before. Also, the recent modifications to the Cas9 endonuclease to allow CRISPR to perform tasks that were previously not possible shows that there might be many more options in store, aside from the ease of CRISPR gene knockout techniques.</p><p>‍</p>",

It can be used to delete genes and exons, change individual base pairs through the introduction of point mutations, and introduce specific conditions for the purpose of triggering the modifications it facilitates. The process typically requires the generation of a particular vector for each gene that it targets, and it can be utilized on any gene, regardless of its size, function or transcriptional activity.</p><h3 id="""">Understanding Gene Targeting and Its Practical Applications in Genetics</h3><p id="""">Scientists and students interested in gene targeting are at the forefront of one of the most advanced and exciting research areas in human history. The ability to alter specific genes and replace them through homologous recombination has recently been perfected, but it is based on studies dating back to Sternberg and Hamilton’s 1981 research. Gene targeting continued to gain worldwide recognition when, in 2007, scientists Mario Capecchi, Martin Evans and Oliver Smithies received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine using the process to introduce gene modifications in mice with the help of embryonic stem cells.</p><h3 id="""">Targeting Made Easier with CRISPR/Cas9</h3><p id="""">With the use of CRISPR, gene targeting in experiments involving genome engineering, transgenes and gene knockout has advanced to an impressive extent. While gene targeting was always possible with various other gene editing techniques, such as TALENs and the DSB-inducing of nucleases with customized DNA binding, the advent of CRISPR/Cas9 was a refreshing change brought to the world of genetic engineering. Breakthroughs obtained by scientists like Feng Zhang and George Church have shown that CRISPR/Cas9 can be used in human cell cultures and in many other organisms as well, including plants, fruit flies, nematodes and even mice and primates.</p><p id="""">Gene targeting is one of the most significant advantages of the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Not only is CRISPR/Cas9 able to target specific genes with fewer problems and errors, but it also has less difficulty maintaining its accuracy and consistency throughout multiple trials. There are two main components that lead to this superiority, making CRISPR/Cas9 more straightforward and easier to use: reproducible genome cleavage and programmable sgRNA cloning. Even though some aspects that were used to compare Cas9 with other techniques have stayed the same, the differences that set CRISPR/Cas9 apart have led to the possibility of targeted double-strand breaks and improved gene editing overall.</p><h3 id="""">How to Achieve Gene Targeting: Process and Methods</h3><p id="""">Over the years, there have been several gene targeting methods that are currently widely accepted. A mutational approach proved to be invaluable by examining the roles of gene products in complex biological processes specifically in a mammalian system (Smithies et al., 1985). [<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2995814"" target=""_blank"" id="""">1</a>] Gene targeting procedures enable the precise (site-specific) introduction of a mutation to any of the murine genes. Typically, mutations are designed to eliminate gene function, resulting in the generation of ‘‘knockout’’ or ‘‘null mutant’’ mice. The introduction of mutations that produced more subtle alterations in gene function had been achieved. Two major developments made gene targeting experiments feasible: (a) the generation of totipotent embryonic stem (ES) cells, and (b) the elucidation of techniques to achieve homologous recombination in mammalian cells. While this approach has been utilized for several decades to generate mouse models, the most recent technology, CRISPR/Cas9 (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Regions/ CRISPR associated protein) represents an alternative tool to create gene edited mice or other species. These other species where genes have successfully been targeted and modified on a more consistent basis utilizing CRISPR/CAS9 are rats, rabbits, sheep, cattle swine and a variety of fungi. Even though these methods are remarkable advancements in science, they still have to be perfected, and they are not without their limitations.</p><p id="""">There is little evidence of the consequences of off-target genome editing. Indeed, there are only a few assays of genotoxicity based on cells in culture that allow to quantify, stratify and help prevent biological side effects of gene editing in a given target cell population. While many groups have shown improvements in CRISPR gene targeting, the two-donor method continues to lack efficiency, mainly due to the reliability of two simultaneous recombination events in cis, an outcome that is dwarfed by pervasive accompanying undesired editing events. It has been shown that the methods that use one-donor DNA are fairly efficient as they rely on only one recombination event, and the probability of correct insertion of the donor cassette without unanticipated mutational events is much higher. Therefore, one-donor methods offer higher efficiencies for the routine generation of mouse models.</p><h3 id="""">Permanent vs. Conditional Targeting</h3><p id="""">One of the main practical advantages of gene targeting is that it doesn’t have to be permanent. In many cases, permanent targeting solutions are used to obtain changes that are expected to stay in place once they are made. However, with the help of conditional targeting techniques, scientists are able to exercise a greater degree of freedom on the modified genes. They can introduce specific conditions that are accurately targeted to trigger the genetic change at a certain time during the organism’s development, or when a particular tissue-related limitation condition is met.</p><h3 id="""">Gene Trapping and Targeting</h3><p id="""">The homology regions of gene targeting cassettes require a specific process that adapts them to a particular gene that is aimed for modification. In contrast with this requirement, gene trapping utilizes a different process whereby scientists apply the random insertion of a cassette. While gene trapping is easier to apply to larger projects, targeting is far more precise and effective when it comes to aiming for specific results. Smaller genes are just as easily targeted as larger ones, and the procedure can also be utilized on genes with low transcriptions that would normally be ignored when it comes to gene trapping.</p><h3 id="""">Cas9: The Simplest Method for Genome Targeting</h3><p id="""">There are many discussions among scientists regarding the relationship between CRISPR and gene targeting. The main answer here is the Cas9 protein, which was named as the component to one of the most accurate systems ever used for genome engineering and gene targeting. The Cas9 system was first used shortly after the development of the initial CRISPR/Cas methods. It was eventually perfected by Jennifer Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier, who recombined the two RNAs into a single guide RNA that could more easily target and cut the specified DNA components. Scientists were even able to obtain effective genetic edits in human tripronuclear zygotes in 2015, marking a new stage for human genetic engineering with the help of the CRISPR/Cas9 technique.</p><h3 id="""">Targeting Differences: Cas9 vs Cpf1</h3><p id="""">In 2015, an important competitor appeared in the CRISPR gene targeting space, which continues to contest the accuracy of gene targeting obtained using Cas9. Cpf1 is a newly discovered nuclease that has successfully been used as a substitute for the Cas9 protein. While results were similar, Cpf1 gene editing resulted in a more “staggered” cut and the need for only a single CRISPR RNA. Moreover, Cpf1 techniques have led to surprisingly positive results when it came to more successful target-specific DNA assembly and superior multiplexed genome editing results.</p><h3 id="""">Practical Gene Mutations and CRISPR’s Role in Genome Engineering Advancements</h3><p id="""">The targeting process has already led to many important successes in the field of genetics and medicine. It is most often used to study human diseases and the effects that the manipulation of specific genes might have on them. CRISPR continues to raise the bar when it comes to genetic engineering accuracy. The level of genetic targeting that CRISPR/Cas methods are capable of have made them an important research tool pertaining to fields such as biomedicine, gene function research and cancer research. Moreover, with CRISPR, new avenues are open when it comes to successful in vivo genome editing, which was obtained in a number of target organisms such as knockout and knockin mice. Also, the development of specific genetic mutations in humanized mice has led to the creation of accurate human disease models that would have been impossible to create without the use of human test subjects in the past.</p><p id="""">Due to these successes and because of the continuing commercial and research backing that it gets, CRISPR gene targeting has a bright future in the years to come. While gene targeting is still in its infancy when we think of its potential in the next few decades, it lays the foundation for what might be possible in the near and far future with advanced genetics.</p><h3 id="""">References</h3><p id="""">1) Smithies O, Gregg RG, Boggs SS, Koralewski MA, Kucherlapati RS. 1985. <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2995814"" target=""_blank"" id="""">Insertion of DNA sequences into the human chromosomal beta-globin locus by homologous recombination</a>. <em id="""">Nature</em> <strong id="""">317</strong>(6034): 230-4.</p><p id="""">‍</p>",

While knockouts and knock-in genes can offer tremendous insight into the inner workings of the mammalian genome, knockdowns are emerging as a valuable source of research. With CRISPR, obtaining knockdown genes can be far easier than with other techniques, even if they have been used for a long time. Moreover, the future of CRISPR is bright, as a growing number of scientists from all around the world are adopting the technique and adapting it to their research.</p><h3 id="""">What Is Gene Knockdown and Why Do We Use It?</h3><p id="""">So far, when using CRISPR, knockdown techniques aren’t the bulk of the research that most scientists focus on. Gene knockdown is still considered an experimental technique, that however, could prove useful for future practical applications. A knockdown is essentially a gene that had its expression reduced, instead of being stopped altogether (as in the case of a knockout). Knockdown genes can be obtained either through genetic manipulation, through CRISPR, or with reagents such as RNA oligonucleotide or a short DNA.</p><h3 id="""">Permanent vs Transient Knockdowns</h3><p id="""">Aside from the use of CRISPR, knockdown genes can also be obtained with the help of oligonucleotide that temporarily bind to a gene, leading to a temporary or “transient” knockdown. Transient knockdown methods are commonly used in developmental biology, and are frequently referred to as “reverse genetics” techniques. They involve a number of possible options, such as gene binding, the blocking of mRNA translation or the use of siRNA (small interfering RNA).</p><h3 id="""">Using the CRISPR System</h3><p id="""">When it comes to the use of CRISPR, knockdown is more easily obtained than with any other technique, as many experts can admit. The new system was discovered with the help of prokaryotes, although researchers can now use CRISPR for genome editing, and specifically knockdown gene creation, featuring eukaryotic cells as well. The technique for obtaining knockdowns with CriSPR entails the use of proteins known as CRISPR-associated genes, which can be programmed to insert exogenous DNA fragments into a CRISPR repeat locus. This method allows for the production of small RNAs that can serve as a template for Cas proteins to silence that same sequence in a cell. CRISPR is commonly used by many researchers for obtaining knockdowns in various mouse models, for the purpose of fine-tuning their genetic research. The main goal is usually to find the precise mechanism through which the silenced genes work, and what happens when their expression is diminished or stopped.</p><h3 id="""">RNA Interference and Other Knockdown Techniques</h3><p id="""">Aside from CRISPR, knockdown genes can also be obtained through various other means. TALENs and RNA interference are two of the best known methods, and they also enjoy nearly as much popularity as the CRISPR technique. RNA interference uses mRNA degradation to obtain silencing effects in specific genes. This is primarily a research tool that allows for easy screening, and makes it possible for researchers to determine what area of genetic research to focus on next. TALENs is another common method of obtaining knockdowns, which however, focuses on genome manipulation with the help of transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs).</p><h3 id="""">Knockdowns for Future Research and Commercialization</h3><p id="""">When it comes to knockdowns, commercialization is not yet underway in full force, since the method is only in its infancy. Presently, researchers have only just scratched the surface on what is possible with the technique. Knockdown animals such as rats and mice are most commonly used for reverse genetics purposes, and there are several companies that make knockdown mouse models available commercially. With the help of CRISPR, knockdown genes are easier to obtain than ever before, and the technique shows great promise for future study.</p><p id="""">‍</p>",

With the help of CRISPR knockouts, scientists are confident that they can find the genes and gene functions responsible for a number of diseases and important protective functions, so that genetic therapies can be develop to counteract problems that were believed to be insurmountable.</p><h3 id="""">What Are Knockouts and Why Are They Needed?</h3><p id="""">There is a lot to consider about knockouts and their role in molecular biology and medicine. Suffice it to say that a knockout is the deletion of a specific, target gene that fulfills a certain function. A CRISPR knockout is simply a knockout gene obtained through the use of methods such as the CRISPR Cas system. The need for knockouts has to do with the study of particular gene functions and how they impact the body. By creating knockout mice, researchers can understand how a certain gene works, and what functions are impaired when the gene is inactivated.</p><h3 id="""">The CRISPR/Cas Technique</h3><p id="""">Before starting with your preferred method to create a CRISPR knockout, it’s important to have a clear overview of how the process will unfold. The CRISPR Cas9 method is a simplified technique that can easily be used to create gene knockouts at specified, target sequences. CRISPR uses a guide RNA, or gRNA, which instructs the Cas9 protein to mark the target sequences that have to be eliminated and create breakages that facilitate this process. Your goals will, therefore, be to design your guide RNA, synthesize it, and deliver it, along with the Cas9 protein, to your target cells. Once the process is completed, detecting indels and finding your gene knockouts is all that’s left to be done.</p><h3 id="""">Generating an Insertion/Deletion Knockout with CRISPR</h3><p id="""">Because it uses the cell’s natural processes for repairing breaks caused by the Cas9 protein – methods such as homologous directed repair (HDR), or the more active non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair technique – the CRISPR knockout method is considered simpler and more elegant than other knockouts. Since you can design your own gRNA, you can decide precisely which sequence the Cas9 protein will target. The protein will then latch itself onto the target sequence and create a double-strand break. Once this happens, the cell’s imperfect repair mechanism will allow for the easy creation of cell lines that feature indel knockouts.</p><h3 id="""">Planning Your CRISPR Experiment</h3><p id="""">Before starting to even consider a CRISPR knockout, you have to plan and see what you actually have to do. One of the first requirements is to determine whether or not to use a specific cell line. Which cell line are you using? Are you considering primary or post-mitotic cell lines? The latter will likely present you with better results when you use viral vectors, although the process can be more time-consuming. Additional factors to take into account also include deciding on which type of Cas9 system to use. AAV is good for a maximum cargo size of about 4.5 kb, while a smaller Cas9 might be more appropriate if you need additional control elements. Finally, it’s also important to read up on SpCas9, if you want to make sure you can reduce unwanted, off-target mutations.</p><h3 id="""">The Benefits of Knockout Mouse Models</h3><p id="""">Knockout mice are some of the most common laboratory animals used for genetic research. Mouse models are easy to develop and can offer many possible genetic enhancements that are relevant to the field of human genetic study. This fact is partly possible because of the fact that mice are genetically similar to humans, but also because humanized mouse models are easy to develop. Mice developed with the CRISPR knockout technique are available for purchase at relatively accessible prices, and you can often get additional benefits such as several genetically independent cell lines, relevant genetic backgrounds and short development time.</p><p>‍</p>",

Designed to create quick and efficient changes within DNA, gene editing systems such as CRISPR/Cas9 are extremely popular today. Through the use of CRISPR based methods, scientists maybe able to answer complex questions involving the expression of specific genes within an organism, and how that can impact health. CRISPR contributes to the the most efficient methods in creating transgenic mouse models, such as mice that are genetically modified to carry various human diseases for the purpose of studying disease progression and treatment methods.</p><h3 id="""">CRISPR and Its Origins</h3><p id="""">By using CRISPR, transgenic mice can be produced more easily today. However, that wasn’t always the case. The CRISPR/Cas9 system is fairly new, and researchers had only just developed similar techniques for genome modifications in the early 2000s. The advent of zinc finger nucleases marked the rise of the first technology for creating double-stranded breaks in DNA at particular and well-determined points. This technique was followed 10 years later by TALENs – another method for obtaining gene knockouts. Finally, CRISPR was developed in 2013, and it’s now a predominant technique used to knock in and knock out genes in mouse embryos and stem cells.</p><h3 id="""">Transgenic Mice – What Are They All About?</h3><p id="""">When it comes to the successes of using CRISPR, generating transgenic mice is counted among the most helpful and practical ones. But what are they? A transgene is typically referred to as a gene that is transferred from one organism to another. Although that sounds simple, the process is quite complex, requiring multiple components, such as a promoter that determines the conditions for the transgene’s activity, an exon representing a specific protein coding sequence, and a stop sequence. In mammals such as mice, the process of obtaining transgenic organisms is usually done through the injection of a transgene into the nucleus of a fertilized egg.</p><h3 id="""">CRISPR and Mouse Genome Editing</h3><p id="""">With the RNA-guided DNA endonuclease Cas9 and tailored guide RNAs that are used in CRISPR methods, transgenic mice can be easier to obtain. Using CRISPR, researchers can readily obtain mutant mice with both alleles of their gene of interest. The CRISPR system offers a simple, one-step process for getting to those results faster, and can make it possible to bypass the sometimes problematic and difficult procedure of creating modified mouse ES cells.</p><h3 id="""">Types of Transgenic Mouse Models</h3><p id="""">Common types of genetically modified mouse models include oncomice and knockout mice. There are also nearly as many different strains of transgenic mouse models as one could imagine, each developed for a specific purpose or type of study. For instance, the use of mouse strains such as BALB/c is usually reserved to research involving immunology, while NOD mouse models are able to help with the creation of autoimmunity defects and instances of metabolic syndrome in mice. With CRISPR, transgenic mice featuring their own version of human genes can also be developed for the purpose of further studying human diseases, without the use of actual human cells.</p><h3 id="""">The Main Uses of Transgenic Mice</h3><p id="""">Transgenic mice can be used for many different purposes. With the help of knockout mice, scientists are able to see what eliminating a specific gene function can do to the body, and how that relates to the development of certain diseases and the effectiveness of treatments. Oncomice are primarily used in cancer research, involving mice expressing transgenes that are able to increase the mouse’s predisposition for developing cancer. With the help of CRISPR, transgenic mice of different types can be obtained, and the procedure is being further through developed newer advancements that are underway today.</p><p>‍</p>",

Cell culturing can be limited to specific cell strains, or led toward the development of cell lines that show little or no limit when it comes to their regenerative and growing abilities – as in the case of stem cell lines. Understanding cell cultures and strains at a deeper level can lead to many significant breakthroughs in genetics, medical science, biochemical research and a host of other study areas.</p><h3 id="""">Defining Cell Cultures</h3><p id="""">When cells are grown in a lab or any other type of controlled environment, regardless of the types of cells we are talking about, the process is known as cell culturing. Depending on each cell type and the purpose of the experiment, the environment of the cell culture can vary. The basic principle of it is to add all the necessary nutrients to keep the cells alive, including materials and nutrients such as basic atmospheric gases, sugars, vitamins, amino acids, minerals and hormones. Many cell cultures also require a stable surface where they can grow.</p><h3 id="""">What Is a Cell Strain?</h3><p id="""">When cells are grown in an artificial environment, it is possible to derive or select specific cells from those cell lines for various specific purposes. For example, you can extract non-immortalized cells from a cell line, alter them with the help of chemicals or a genetically modified virus, and watch them mutate or grow until senescence makes it impossible for them to divide any longer. Such processes are known as cell strains, and can also be obtained through the cloning of the cells in question.</p><h3 id="""">The Growth and Manipulation of Cell Cultures and Strains</h3><p id="""">Cultured cells and strains can be manipulated in a variety of ways once they are maintained in a stable environment. Some of the manipulation techniques involved include passaging cells, media changes and transfecting cells. Laminar flow cabinets are typically used for manipulating cultured cells, and antibiotics or anti-fungal agents can also be added in order to eliminate any kind of chance of infection or contamination. Media changes involve either removing the cell strains or cultures from their medium using a method of aspiration or centrifuging them to add them to a fresh media. In transfection, the deliberate introduction of nucleic acids can be used to achieve the expression of a certain gene. Finally, the process of passaging cells usually involves separating some of the cells from the initial culture to reduce cell density and allow the cells to be cultured for a longer period of time.</p><h3 id="""">Isolated Cells</h3><p id="""">Specific cells derived from cell lines and cell strains can be isolated from the tissue they would normally require to grow. A few examples include white blood cells, which can be separated for growth in a culture, or mononuclear cells, which are released from the tissues they normally reside in through a process of artificial digestion using various enzymes like trypsin or collagenase. When cells are isolated from primary cells and allowed to grow for a particular purpose, usually having to do with a particular research study, they are also regarded as cell strains.</p><p id="""">‍</p>",

As science progresses, systems based on basic mouse knockouts and the development of conditional gene inactivation through the Cre-lox system continue to progress significantly in their accuracy and in providing concrete, practical and usable results.</p><h3 id="""">Selecting the Correct Mouse Models</h3><p id="""">Before a conditional gene knockout mouse can be developed, the correct mouse models have to be found and properly prepared for the process. While many types of mice can be used, the best are models that already have a null allele in their germline, and can be prepared to become mouse models of various diseases or to help researchers study gene targeting in ES cells, as well as in vitro gene function. While these mice typically have short lifespans, the Cre-lox recombination system can also be used to study their development as adult mice.</p><h4 id="""">How the Conditional Gene Knockout Process Works</h4><p id="""">In order to develop a conditional gene knockout mouse, it’s necessary to understand how conditional gene knockouts really work. The process differs from methods that are used to obtain traditional gene knockouts, because conditional gene knockouts feature inactivations that occur at a certain, designated time. To overcome many of the problems that are associated with regular gene knockouts – such as random targeting or accidental embryonic death – researchers adopt technologies like Cre-lox. This allows them to target specific tissues, inactivate genes only in adulthood, or induce a change that allows them to study the development of impaired tissue over a longer period of time.</p><h5 id="""">Conditional Gene Inactivation with the Cre-lox System</h5><p id="""">With the help of the Cre-lox system, obtaining conditional gene knockouts is relatively easy. The recombination essentially allows for the two strands of DNA to exchange information with each other. The result is a recombination between the two lox sites that can be obtained at a specific time with the help of chemicals like tamoxifen and tetracycline. These compounds have the role of activating the transcription of the Cre recombinase and initiating its transport to the nucleus. If researchers are able to find practical ways to express the Cre-recombinase in a living organism such as a mouse – which is typically the most difficult part of the experiment – there can be extremely valuable obtained results.</p><h5 id="""">The Uses of Conditional Gene Knockouts</h5><p id="""">A conditional gene knockout mouse can be an important tool to genetic researchers. Many scientists use these mouse models to analyze and study the origination of diseases and genetic impairments that occur when certain genes are inactivated at specific times. This practice has allowed geneticists to study complex diseases like cancer and their development at a molecular level. The development of cancer cells can now be monitored at every stage of its progression. In addition, the new insights that practices such as the deletion of the BRCA1 allele in the mouse’s mammary gland tissue have already led to significant breakthroughs in tumor suppression. Conditional gene knockout mouse models are constantly being utilized to map the normal development of the body, as well as the progression of a number of genetic diseases that the Cre-lox system allows scientists to mimic quite faithfully.</p><p>‍</p>",

Genes can have different functions during an individual’s lifespan. Most dramatically, a gene may be essential for the proper development of an organism before birth, and then later in life can maintain a different function and influence the individual’s susceptibility towards a disease.</p><p id="""">Techniques and technologies for creating conditional knockout mice continue to be developed, to help make the process more straightforward. By pairing conditional knockout mice with various existing Cre mouse lines, researchers are able to investigate many different gene knockout outcomes based on specific cells or tissues in which the gene has been deleted. In cases where an appropriate cell- or tissue-specific Cre mouse line does not already exist, researchers can develop their own custom Cre mouse line, which can then be shared with the research community as well.</p><h3 id="""">What Is Conditional Knockout?</h3><p id="""">As a gene elimination process, the conditional knockout has many important uses when it comes to studying the role of particular genes in keeping the body in good health. Conditional gene knockout has to do with the controlled influence of the knockout process. This procedure is designed to help researchers target genes in specific tissues to render them inert. Conditional knockouts also eliminate the drawbacks and side effects of traditional knockout processes that eliminate genes from the entire body.</p><h3 id="""">Techniques for Obtaining a Conditional Knockout Mouse</h3><p id="""">The Cre-lox recombination system is the most prevalent method used for obtaining conditional knockout mice. Recombination between two loxP sites is catalyzed by the Cre recombinase enzyme. This process causes the two recombining strands of DNA to exchange information and results in a deletion or an inversion between the two loxP sites. The Cre-lox system thus enables conditional gene knockout by the introduction of loxP sites into or surrounding the gene of interest and subsequent deletion of the loxP-flanked gene by tissue-specific Cre. To further advance the versatility of conditional knockouts, drug-inducible Cre enzymes have been developed, the most common of which is the tamoxifen-inducible CreERT2. By using inducible Cre enzymes, researchers are able to achieve both tissue-specific and temporal-specific knockout of the loxP-flanked gene.</p><p id=""""><em id="""">“We are 100% satisfied with iTL’s service in generating this mouse model for us.

The application of animal models that are developed using this methodology has to do with modeling human diseases accurately in other mammals – primarily in mice.

Today, protocols such as the Cre-lox recombination system are commonplace, and researchers are also coming up with newer, more complex conditional knockout protocols like the Red-pathway-mediated recombination.</p><h3 id="""">The Importance of Knockout Mice</h3><p id="""">Before covering conditional knockout mouse protocol methods, it’s necessary to highlight the crucial role played by knockout mice. Knockout mouse models are genetically altered mice that are meant to exemplify the way in which turning off a certain gene can affect the body as a whole. Since they were first developed, knockout mice and conditional knockout mouse models have helped scientists find improved treatments and cures to a number of diseases. Moreover, they have even assisted in tackling problematic and often fatal illnesses such as heart disease, diabetes, different forms of cancer, Alzheimer’s disease and many more. With newly developed conditional knockout mouse protocols, it is now possible for researchers to study the genomic changes that happen when a gene is impaired much more closely than in the past.</p><h4 id="""">Conditional Knockout Genes</h4><p id="""">Conditional knockout mouse protocol techniques and procedures for altering the mouse genome are primarily based on conditional knockouts. This concept was first introduced quite recently in the world of genetics, and is based on the goal of eliminating a specific gene that targets a particular tissue within the body. For example, conditional knockouts can be developed to impair a particular function that only affects the liver or to alter genes that affect the proper functioning of the heart. These methods are extremely valuable due to the possibilities they present, allowing scientists to closely monitor how the impairment of a certain gene can affect the functioning of an organ or the integrity of a specific type of tissue within the body.</p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image "" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""""><div id=""""><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/665dc660af52559c0ed6ec8b/667b2acb44f58580d203e612_Downloadable-Icon-min.png"" alt="""" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto"" id=""""></div></figure><p id="""">Download Our <strong id="""">Free</strong> Conditional Knockout (cKO) Quick Guide</p><p id=""""><a href=""http://go.genetargeting.com/conditional-ko-quick-guide"" target=""_blank"" id=""""><strong id="""">GET YOUR COPY</strong></a></p><h5 id="""">Common Techniques for Generating Knockouts</h5><p id="""">The Cre-lox recombination system is the most commonly utilized system for generating knockouts in any types of animals.

This process then leads to the deletion or inversion of specific genes within the lox, depending how they are oriented. This system is most often used with the help of chemicals like tetracycline, which can be introduced to trigger a conditional gene knockout at a specific time.</p><h6 id="""">New and Advanced Knockout Protocols</h6><p id="""">A more advanced conditional knockout mouse protocol is the Red-pathway-mediated recombination, which was designed to capture various genomic fragments into a Gateway-compatible vector. This technique is used together with other recombineering techniques and simple in vitro gateway recombinations to study the effects of precisely targeted gene disruptions at shorter notice. These types of conditional knockout mouse protocol methods can be used without the need for advanced lab equipment, and are considered more precise than past techniques.</p><p id="""">‍</p>",

While one is easier to obtain and has to do with the deletion of a specific gene at a global level – meaning, everywhere – the other type of knockout focuses on eliminating the function of a gene at a local level. Among the different categorizations of knockout mice, these two are considered among the most crucial when it comes to the diversity of the range of experiments that genetic researchers can perform.</p><h3 id="""">Understanding the Gene Knockout Process</h3><p id="""">Despite the fact that genetic researchers have successfully managed to map the human genome, the complexity of interactions between different genes can be extensive. To understand the difference between a conditional knockout mouse and global knockout mouse, it’s important to first understand how gene knockouts work and help researchers shed light on gene functioning. The basic idea is simple: by knocking out a gene, scientists hope to understand its function and the way it influences the body as a whole. However, in many cases, genes don’t behave in a straightforward manner. Sometimes, a gene only operates within the confines of a limited system, and at other times, it might even take the silencing of another gene to discover the function of the targeted one. As a result, it is essential that different types of knockouts are sometimes used, in order to obtain more accurate results.</p><h3 id="""">Global Knockout Mouse Models</h3><p id="""">When considering the differences between a conditional knockout mouse and global knockout mouse, we have to understand what each of them are. Global knockout mice, as the name would suggest, are knockout mice that are obtained through the global elimination of a gene’s function. Global deletions have to be handled with care, as in most cases, they can result in major changes in behavior and health. For example, the deletion of a gene like the Nav1.7 gene will lead to severe changes in the mouse’s body when it comes to recognizing pain. However, scientists have also found that the global deletion of this gene is lethal in mice, and have since utilized gene editing methods based on conditional knockouts to further their research.</p><h2 id=""""><strong id="""">Subscribe to our newsletter?

For example, researchers can perform a knockout that only targets a certain organ, while the gene continues to operate in the rest of the body. Conditional knockout mice are far more diverse than global models, since they can also be “programmed” to experience the gene knockout at a certain time.</p><h3 id="""">The Practical Benefits of a Conditional Knockout</h3><p id="""">Conditional knockout mice have experienced a significant surge in popularity due to their practical advantages. A conditional mouse model can be used to evaluate the details of how a certain gene behaves in a single organ or tissue, making it easy for researchers to study the local effects of various diseases and genetic impairments. When compared, the main difference between a conditional knockout mouse and a global knockout mouse is the practical specificity of the conditional model, which allows for a far greater range of applications than its global knockout counterpart.</p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image "" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""""><div id=""""><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/665dc660af52559c0ed6ec8b/667b2acb44f58580d203e612_Downloadable-Icon-min.png"" alt="""" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto"" id=""""></div></figure><p id="""">Download Our <strong id="""">Free</strong> Conditional Knockout (cKO) Quick Guide</p><p id=""""><a href=""http://go.genetargeting.com/conditional-ko-quick-guide"" target=""_blank"" id=""""><strong id="""">GET YOUR COPY</strong></a></p><p id="""">‍</p>",

This is a type of mutation that depends on certain conditions, and can easily lead to the alteration of the cell or even to mass cell death. This volatile property is what makes conditional mutations so interesting. Some researchers have found ways to exploit this fact, and are actively using conditional mutations in the lab, to induce and study certain genetic changes and their consequences.</p><h3 id="""">How Do Conditional Mutations Really Work?</h3><p id="""">A conditional mutation works by changing its result based on the severity of a certain factor or environmental trait. Some mutations remain benign and harmless until the factor in question reaches a certain value. Once it passes that value, the phenotype changes from a “wild-type” or normal phenotype to a mutant phenotype that responds severely to restrictive environmental conditions. This, in turn, might cause a number of results, each leading to impaired function or cellular death. Light, temperature or the presence of certain chemicals can actively induce a conditional mutation. In many cases, this happens naturally, however, some scientists were also able to accurately mimic nature and create controlled conditional mutations in the lab.</p><h3 id="""">Specific Examples of Conditional Mutations</h3><p id="""">There are many examples of conditional mutations and the diseases that they can cause. These mutations can sometimes result in defective functions that render the organism incapable of surviving under specific conditions. One of the best example is the temperature-dependent or temperature-sensitive mutation. These mutations cause the organism to be at risk of cell death when the temperature rises above or diminishes below a certain level. In such cases, the restrictive temperature condition leads to severe dysfunction. On the other hand, permissive conditions under normal temperatures will more likely lead to the mutation displaying a wild-type phenotype which only causes mild effects.</p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image "" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""""><div id=""""><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/665dc660af52559c0ed6ec8b/667b2acb44f58580d203e612_Downloadable-Icon-min.png"" alt="""" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto"" id=""""></div></figure><p id="""">Download Our <strong id="""">Free</strong> Conditional Knockout (cKO) Quick Guide</p><p id=""""><a href=""http://go.genetargeting.com/conditional-ko-quick-guide"" target=""_blank"" id=""""><strong id="""">GET YOUR COPY</strong></a></p><h3 id="""">The Importance of These Mutations</h3><p id="""">A conditional mutation is sometimes needed when the regular means of research fail. If, for example, we try to use a transgenic mouse model to study the overexpression of a gene, that model will present the same expression all the time. However, if we want to save time by comparing proteins that have the gene expressed in specific tissues at specific times, then the classical model for transgenes no longer stands. In such cases, conditional mutations provide us with an “on/off switch” that allows for the gene to be expressed only under certain conditions. These conditions can, of course, be controlled so that a viable experiment can be set up at short notice.</p><h3 id="""">The Research Applications of the Mutation</h3><p id="""">A transcriptional switch of the kind we have just described can be used, for example, to alter the expression of a gene based on whether or not a steroid ligand is present. Alternatively, it can also be possible to study the effect of IL4 in an asthma transgenic mouse model by turning IL4 on and off with the help of conditional mutations. There are many other possible applications, and with the help of techniques such as CRISPR/Cas4, implementing them is easier than ever. As a result, researchers can use a wide array of conditional mutation changes to study gene expression far more dynamically than ever before.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">RELATED:</strong> <a href=""https://genetargeting.com/conditional-knockout-mouse-models/"" target=""_blank"" id="""">Conditional Knockout Mouse Models</a></p><p id="""">‍</p>",

The knockout process is designed to inactivate a gene in an organism with the help of an artificial piece of DNA used to replace or disable the gene in question. Conventional knockouts are of interest to the scientific community because of the role they play in determining the numerous unknown details of why a certain gene behaves as it does. Also, they tell us why gene function might be impaired by certain factors and what can be done to restore it to its natural, healthy behavior.</p><h3 id="""">What’s So Special About Knockout Mice</h3><p id="""">Mouse models are at the forefront of a large percentage of the studies dedicated to understanding DNA sequences and specific, individual genes with the help of conventional knockout procedures. This fact isn’t solely true because mice are genetically similar to humans – since other mammals, such as chimps and apes share an even greater similarity with us in terms of their genetic makeup – but also because mice are small in size, and the specific procedures that make knockout techniques work can be more easily applied to mice than to any other laboratory animal. As opposed to mice, even gene knockout in rats has been extremely difficult to apply, and has only been possible for the past 15 years.</p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image "" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""""><div><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/665dc660af52559c0ed6ec8b/667b2acb44f58580d203e612_Downloadable-Icon-min.png"" alt="""" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto"" id=""""></div></figure><p id="""">Download Our <strong id="""">Free</strong> Conditional Knockout (cKO) Quick Guide</p><p id=""""><a href=""http://go.genetargeting.com/conditional-ko-quick-guide"" target=""_blank"" id=""""><strong id="""">GET YOUR COPY</strong></a></p><h3 id="""">Conventional vs. Conditional Knockouts</h3><p id="""">Unlike conditional mouse models, in which genes are inactivated in a specific location or tissue, a conventional knockout is much broader in scope. These knockouts involve disabling a gene throughout the entire organism, which is why their outcomes can be harder to predict and to control. Knocking out a gene in the entire body, however, can shed crucial light on what the role of that gene is in each and every area of the organism. With its help, researchers can have a much broader and more detailed view of how the knockout gene influences even some of the most subtle processes in the body and how its inactivation can contribute to or impair the development of various diseases.</p><h3 id="""">Strains of Knockout Mice</h3><p id="""">While more advanced procedures such as conditional knockouts and conventional knockouts in rats have not been around as long, conventional knockout mice have been used long enough for scientists to develop thousands of useful strains. To make nomenclature easier to keep track of, most mouse models are named after the gene that’s been knocked out. Strains are developed after careful evaluation of the types of genes that are most important to explore – such as genes responsible for encoding proteins that have tumor-suppressant properties. Such strains have effectively helped scientists learn about the subtler processes of what causes tumors to form and how they can be countered.</p><h3 id="""">The Production of Conventional Models with Advanced Technology</h3><p id="""">Advancements in genetic technology are being made every year. The latest technologies, like CRISPR and advanced transgenic procedures are considered the cutting edge today, when it comes to greatly diminishing the limitations of using conventional knockouts for genetic research and the development of genetic therapies. When it comes to the details of a conventional knockout and its function, scientists hope to gradually use these techniques and their future versions to prevent embryo fatality and develop better, more accurate humanized mouse models to account for instances when the genetic differences between mice and human DNA are too great.</p><p>‍</p>",

Conventional or whole-body knockouts were originally considered the most advanced genetic engineering technology for mouse models some 30 years ago. The latest techniques in use today, however, allow for far greater accuracy and efficiency in studying human disease by allowing conditional deletion or activation of target genes in a manner that better mimics the human condition. &nbsp;Conditional knockout in particular is ideal for ensuring that many of the most common limitations of conventional knockout techniques can be bypassed entirely.</p><h3 id="""">The Basics of Conventional and Conditional Knockout Methods</h3><p id="""">When it comes to comparing conventional vs. conditional knockout methods, it helps to know the basics. While conventional knockouts were developed first and involve animal models with artificially impaired or eliminated genes in all tissues of the body, conditional knockouts are more advanced, involving gene knockouts that only target specific tissues or organs. For example, in order to study a disease that affects the liver, scientists might use a conditional knockout that eliminates a specific gene only in that specific organ. Their results can then become much more accurate in terms of the drugs and genetic therapies developed to help people living with liver disease.</p><h3 id="""">The Drawbacks of Traditional Conventional Knockout Methods</h3><p id="""">In terms of understanding the drawbacks of conventional vs. conditional knockout models, it’s important to remember that conventional knockout is a knockout that can affect all cell types. Some cells are required for embryonic development and if important cells are affected by gene knockout during embryo development, a mouse model may never come to fruition due to embryonic lethality. Also, the gene of interest will be knocked out at all times and in all tissues where the gene is active with a conventional knockout. This limits studies on what occurs in the mouse during different stages of activation and deactivation of the gene of interest because in the case of a conventional KO, the gene is always inactivated.</p><h3 id="""">How Do Conditional Knockout Mouse Models Work?</h3><p id="""">The Cre-loxP system is used to study gene function in selected cell types and/or at specified time points. &nbsp;Two mouse lines are required for this system to work. &nbsp;In the first mouse line, loxP sites are inserted into a target gene of interest, in introns and typically flanking a critical region of the gene. &nbsp;Prior to administration of Cre recombinase, this mouse model functions like wild type. &nbsp;Once mated to a second mouse line containing the Cre transgene, Cre recombinase can act on the loxP sites, excising the DNA between the loxP sites to create a gene knockout of the target gene. &nbsp;Tissue- and/or time-specificity is determined by which promoter is driving the Cre transgene. &nbsp;For instance, if Cre is being driven by a lung-specific promoter, then only cells that express the target gene in the lungs will have a knockout of the target gene in the lungs.</p><h3 id="""">Why Are New Conditional Knockout Techniques so Desirable?</h3><p id="""">When considering conventional vs. conditional knockouts, it’s important to realize that from the start, conditional knockouts had more capabilities than conventional knockouts. With a conditional KO, gene inactivation can occur in a certain tissue type or at a specific time point made possible by mating a loxP mouse with a specific Cre line available in repositories. Traditionally conventional and conditional mouse models were made by manipulating the gene of interest first in embryonic stem cells that would have to be selected and screened for proper targeting, then injected into blastocysts in order to produce live mice. Today, advanced technologies such as CRISPR/Cas9 can be used to inject zygotes directly, eliminating the time-consuming embryonic stem cell work of the traditional approach. Researchers are potentially able to achieve knockout sooner, and sometimes homozygous knockouts can be found right from the start.</p><h3 id="""">The Advantages of Cutting Edge Gene Editing with Conditional Knockouts</h3><p id="""">Almost a decade after the initial development of the CRISPR/Cas9 technique, this and other advanced technologies for obtaining conditional knockouts have become more popular and widely used than conventional techniques. Newer technologies allow for simplicity and efficiency, diminishing the time required to obtain modified target genes and enhancing the bioinformatics tools of the past to identify appropriate RNA sequences. When it comes to the advantages or disadvantages between conventional vs. conditional knockout models, it’s safe to say that the added flexibility of conditional knockout along with new technological knockout methods favor the easier and more result-driven conditional knockout methods, to the older, traditional techniques of making a conventional knockout.</p><h2 id="""">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ):</h2><h4 id="""">Is conditional knockout permanent?</h4><p id="""">With a traditional or conventional knockout, a target gene is permanently inactivated in all tissues at all time points, while <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_knockout#:~:text=There%20are%20two%20main%20types,times%20or%20in%20specific%20tissues."" target=""_blank"" id="""">a conditional knockout allows for the target gene to be turned off</a> at specific times or in specific tissues.</p><h4 id="""">How do you make conditional knockout mice?</h4><p id="""">Conditional knockout mice are obtained <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21080282/#:~:text=Conditional%20mutant%20mice%20are%20obtained,the%20expression%20domain%20of%20Cre."" target=""_blank"" id="""">by crossing a loxP or “floxed” line with a Cre transgenic line</a>. &nbsp;The target gene becomes inactivated in vivo within the expression domain of Cre.</p><h4 id="""">What is a floxed mouse?</h4><p id="""">Floxing is <a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/floxing#:~:text=ES%20cell%20level.-,Floxing%20is%20the%20introduction%20of%20specific%20sequences%2C%20on%20either%20side,in%20a%20CA1%2Dspecific%20manner."" target=""_blank"" id="""">the introduction of loxP sequences on either side of a targeted gene</a>. &nbsp;The presence of Cre recombinase leads to deletion of the intervening sequences. </p><h4 id="""">What are the methods of knockout mice?</h4><p id=""""><a href=""https://genetargeting.com/knockout/knockout-mouse-made/#:~:text=Gene%20Targeting%20%E2%80%93%20A%20Method%20for,targeting%20of%20large%20genomic%20regions."" target=""_blank"" id="""">Gene targeting is a method used for creating knockout mice</a> using embryonic stem cells, or ESCs. &nbsp;The homologous recombination process in ESCs is robust and allows for specific gene targeting of large genomic regions.</p>",

As many seasoned experts will tell you, floxing is an extremely useful and powerful process by which the Cre-lox system is used to its highest potential. By flanking a DNA sequence between two of its loxP sites, researchers are able to control the knockout process to a greater extent, allowing for advantages such as tissue-specific gene manipulation and the ability to trigger the change at a specific time or through the use of a particular type of trigger.</p><p id="""">To understand floxed mice, we first have to know how the Cre-lox system really works. Cre-lox recombination is a type of genetic technology that allows for deletions, inversions, insertions and translocations at particular, targeted genetic sites, which can often be triggered through the use of a controlled external stimulus. As a result, the correct use of the system will allow for the activation, repression or exchange of a gene, depending on the needs of the experiment at hand. The technology was initially developed by Dr. Brian Sauer of Dupont, then later perfected to perform deletions and tissue-specific manipulation by Drs. Jamey Marth and Joe Z. Tsien.</p><p id="""">Where does floxing come in, and why was it developed? The term “flox” actually describes the merging of the terms “loxP” and “flanking,” aptly pointing towards the nature of the floxing process. The procedure involves flanking a DNA sequence through the use of the two loxP sites that flank it. Through this process, researchers are able to specifically target genes for deletion, exchange or inversion, creating a highly accurate means of obtaining the spatial and temporal manipulation of the gene’s expression. Any gene targeted in floxed mice can, therefore, be altered depending on whether it has to be repressed, completely inactivated or replaced with another gene. As a result, researchers are able to change the gene expression according to specific parameters, or even induce it at a certain time. Furthermore, using precise methods, floxed genes can be limited to a certain tissue – such as the heart, the lungs, the skin or the liver – allowing for an unprecedented level of control when conducting genetic manipulation experiments.</p><p id="""">Floxed mice have a variety of helpful and practical uses. By altering genes using definitive parameters and targeting specific times and tissues, researchers are able to closely study the relation between the gene and a specific disorder or impairment that affects the tissue in question. Diseases like cancer, diabetes and heart disease, which are known to only affect certain types of tissues or cells, can be meticulously examined and with remarkable results. Moreover, many breakthroughs have also been made in the study of genetic diseases that not only affect only certain tissues or body functions, but are also difficult to research due to their rare occurrence and the limited information and statistical data available on affected patients. By breeding floxed mice, genetic researchers can manipulate the mouse genome to obtain changes similar to those that occur as a result of these diseases. From there, they may be able to develop treatments and drugs that can inhibit or activate the necessary genes to trigger the healing process, or at least reduce the negative effects of the disease.</p><p id="""">‍</p>",

In essence, the method allows scientists to manipulate specific genes in the mouse genome in order to study results that may help determine whether or not a treatment for a type of genetic disease will be effective in both mice and humans.</p><h2 id="""">How Does Cre Recombinase Aid in the Production of Floxed Genes?</h2><p id="""">Before delving into the details of why the Cre recombinase and the Cre/lox recombination method is so effective for facilitating the floxing of genes and producing targeted conditional alleles, it’s important to first understand how the method itself works. Cre recombinase is a tyrosine enzyme that can be used efficiently in the Cre recombination system in order to carry out site-specific recombination events and ultimately catalyze the recombination event between two specifically chosen DNA recognition sites, which are also known as LoxP sites. This, as well as the product of its catalyzing effect, will be determined by the relative orientation and the particular location of the loxP sites.</p><p id="""">So, where does floxing come into all this? As two separate loxP sites undergo fusion as a result of the use of Cre recombinase, the DNA sequence that is located between those two sites will become “floxed.” In this case, the location of the Cre recombination sequence is precisely determined, and the product of the floxing will depend entirely on the orientation of the two loxP sites. Should the sites be oriented in the same direction, the result will be a circular DNA loop. If, on the other hand, the orientation of the two sites oppose each other, the DNA found between the two loxP sites will be inverted.</p><p id="""">When it comes to the creation of flox mice, the use of the Cre/lox recombination system is extremely valuable. It is in fact considered to be one of the most powerful and important tools in the mouse geneticist’s arsenal. The reason for that is the Cre/lox recombination method’s ability to produce tissue-specific knockouts, as well as other highly specific and accurate spacial and temporal alterations of gene expression.</p><p id="""">In terms of using mice to study various genetic diseases or the use of untested prototype drugs and treatments, the specific alteration of genetic expression in various tissues can be essential, if not life-saving. It saves a significant amount of time and energy, as well as producing remarkably accurate results that medical experts and geneticists would not be able to obtain otherwise. When it comes to the future of genetic research, the use of floxed mice and gene alteration through the Cre/lox recombination method is expected to play an even greater role in future research.</p><p id="""">‍</p>",

Using the Cre-lox system in an experiment seems simple: two lines are crossed, one with tissue-specific expression of Cre and one with a floxed target gene. Ideally your gene of interest is knocked out in the tissue you’re studying. Some aspects of the Cre-lox system are overlooked even by experienced researchers, and a greater understanding may alter your future experimental plans.</p><h3 id="""">1. A standard knockout model can be generated from a conditional knockout line.</h3><p id="""">A conditional knockout model offers flexibility that a constitutive or conventional knockout does not, but depending on your project both model types may have applications. It’s straightforward to start with a conditional knockout model and generate a new constitutive knockout line from it, while still separately maintaining the conditional knockout line. Simply mating the conditional knockout line with a line that expresses Cre in germ cells will result in embryos carrying the deletion. This gene-inactivating mutation will be passed on, creating a constitutive knockout line for the gene.</p><h3 id="""">2. Cre can invert a region rather than delete it.</h3><p id="""">The mechanism of Cre recombination requires two lox sites be brought together by looping the intervening DNA. In conditional knockout models the looped sequence is cut away to create a circular DNA molecule. Varying the orientation of the lox elements can cause an alternate reaction during recombination such that the lox-flanked region is inverted rather than deleted. If two wild-type loxP sequences were used to accomplish this the region would invert over and over with no control over the final orientation. It was found that alternate lox sequences could be used to create an irreversible, or locked, inversion. This can be used to place an inverted sequence in a gene where it will initially be spliced over, then after Cre inverts the region the element comes into frame, potentially serving as a reporter or modifier of the targeted gene.</p><h3 id="""">3. Lox site placement is crucial.</h3><p id="""">The lox element used in the Cre-lox system comprises only a 34bp sequence. In most conditional knockout Cre-lox models two loxP sites are placed in introns, flanking one or a few exons. The generally low conservation of intronic sequence might lead one to believe that lox sites can be placed freely. However even such a small introduced sequence can disrupt the gene’s function by interfering with its promoter or splicing. Often the first intron of a gene will contain regulatory DNA sequences and disrupting a key transcription factor binding site could affect the expression of the gene. lox sites should be placed outside of known regulatory regions whenever possible, ideally in regions known to have low conservation across species. lox sites should also be placed at least 150 bases away from splice sites to minimize the chance of disrupting proper splicing.</p><h3 id="""">4. Cre may be active in cells you don’t intend.</h3><p id="""">Your experiments may exclusively employ well-validated Cre lines that are backed by years of successful use. However, even the most accepted Cre lines can have recombinase activity in tissues you don’t expect. The creators of your Cre line had certain experiments planned for it which were probably limited to certain conditions during one part of the mouse’s life cycle. Every way that your experiments vary from theirs creates a possibility of different Cre expression patterns. For example, the promoter driving Cre may be activated by infection or hypoxia or age, and therefore Cre could be expressed when you don’t intend it to be. While that result may be exciting to discover it’s important that it not take you by surprise. Any time a new combination of Cre line and conditional knockout line is used it’s vital to demonstrate that unexpected knockout is not occurring and disrupting your interpretation of results.</p><h3 id="""">5. Chromosomal position and distance between lox sites affect efficiency.</h3><p id="""">Every conditional knockout model has a unique characteristic: the chromosomal location of the targeted gene. Because the epigenetic landscape varies depending on position two conditional lines may be affected differently when used with the same Cre line. In addition, recombination frequency is affected by the distance between lox sites – greater distance results in lower efficiency. These characteristics introduce additional complexity when comparing results from different conditional knockout lines. For example, you may be studying two closely related genes where both are targeted by floxing the third exon, and you cross the two lines to the same Cre line for experiments. Although the distance between lox sites may be almost identical the epigenetic landscape could alter recombination frequency. As a result one gene may be knocked out more efficiently and if this difference isn’t recognized it can affect your experiment in an unanticipated manner. This can also affect how you validate Cre lines because a generic reporter line won’t have its construct in the same location as your target gene. Ideally your conditional knockout line will incorporate its own reporter to give a true representation of knockout efficiency.</p><h3 id="""">6. Cre may not be as active as you think in your target cells.</h3><p id="""">As mentioned above, each conditional knockout line has unique features that affect the efficiency of deletion. The other variable in an experiment is the level and duration of Cre expression. It can happen that a Cre line which has reliably worked for years suddenly seems weak when you cross it with a new conditional knockout line. One possible explanation is that the Cre line was weaker than you thought, but you were using it with conditional knockout lines where the gene deletion was particularly efficient. If your Cre mice lines express in multiple tissues it’s almost certain that their expression levels will vary by cell type. Using a binary off/on reporter to determine where Cre is expressed can obscure these differences – low Cre levels might be enough to trigger the reporter but not reliably work with a conditional knockout line. A new conditional knockout line with a conditional reporter is one way to conclusively know that your target gene has been disrupted when you think it has. You will likely observe that knockout efficiency varies between tissues because of different Cre activity levels.</p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image "" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""""><div id=""""><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/665dc660af52559c0ed6ec8b/667b2acb44f58580d203e612_Downloadable-Icon-min.png"" alt="""" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto"" id=""""></div></figure><h4 id="""">Download Our <strong id="""">Free</strong> Cre-lox Design Guide</h4><p id="""">Learn about the design strategies you need to consider before starting your conditional knockout model.</p><p id=""""><a href=""https://go.genetargeting.com/crelox-design-guide"" target=""_blank"" id=""""><strong id="""">GET YOUR COPY</strong></a></p><p id="""">‍</p>",

These mouse models are used in conjunction with human cells that can be cultured in the lab and also genetically modified. Growing mutated human cells in a dish can be highly informative for figuring out the effects of the mutation. However in many cases the full effects of a mutation can’t be seen unless the cells are living inside an animal or person. This is where animal models such as knockin mice come into the picture. The biology of the mouse is very similar to that of humans in most respects so a mutation in the mouse’s cells will usually have the same effect as it would in a person’s. Scientists who want to study a mutation will evaluate different strategies for making a genetically modified mouse model, for example looking at knockin vs knockout modifications. Creating the best model is a crucial early step in a successful research project. </p><p id="""">The processes for making knockin mice and knockout mice are similar in many ways and require special skills, tools, and reagents. A major difference in knockin vs knockout is that a knockout mutation is always targeted to a precise spot in the mouse’s genome. This is because the goal of a knockout mouse model is to prevent a gene of interest from functioning so the genetic modification must happen in that gene’s sequence. A knockin mutation can be targeted but it’s also possible to insert a knockin sequence randomly into the genome and find out later where it ended up. This method was used to generate some of the very first genetically modified mouse models in the early 1980s, which had new genetic sequences randomly inserted into their genomes. </p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image "" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""""><div id=""""><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/665dc660af52559c0ed6ec8b/667b2acb44f58580d203e612_Downloadable-Icon-min.png"" alt="""" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto"" id=""""></div></figure><p id="""">Download Our <strong id="""">Free</strong> Conditional Knockout (cKO) Quick Guide</p><p id=""""><a href=""http://go.genetargeting.com/conditional-ko-quick-guide"" target=""_blank"" id=""""><strong id="""">GET YOUR COPY</strong></a></p><h2 id="""">How are Knockout Mice Made?</h2><p id="""">It’s relatively easy to describe a <a href=""https://genetargeting.com/knockout/knockout-mouse-made/"" id="""">knockout mouse model</a> because there are only a few methods to make them and the goal is always the same: inactivating a target gene. The most common method today uses CRISPR technology to make a small change near the start of the gene’s coding sequence. Either a small part of the gene is deleted or a small new sequence is added. If the correct modification is made this has the effect of interrupting the gene expression process. The cell’s machinery makes an RNA copy of the mutated DNA, then recognizes something is wrong and destroys the RNA without translating it into protein. Older ways of making knockout mice are broadly similar. A specific part of the gene is removed, sometimes in combination with the addition of a new blocking sequence. With any of these methods the modified copy of the gene is permanently inactivated. </p><h2 id="""">How are Knockin Mice Made?</h2><p id="""">The picture is more complex when talking about knockin vs knockout. <a href=""https://genetargeting.com/knockin/what-is-a-knockin/"" id="""">Knockin mice</a> may have a new genetic sequence added that is turned on in all cells, or only certain cells, or in response to mice receiving a specific drug. The knockin gene might cause a disease in the mice, or correct a problem caused by a different mutation, or mark certain cells with a fluorescent protein label. As mentioned previously the knockin sequence can be put into a specific location or added to a random genomic site. A particularly exciting kind of knockin replaces part of the mouse’s genome with a human DNA sequence. This enables the study of the human gene in the context of a living mouse and knockin mice with human genes will be a powerful tool for researchers.

Generating conditional knockout mouse models requires a certain degree of precision and thorough research regarding the gene that has to be flanked by loxP sites, as well as the specific methods used for targeting and disrupting the gene through floxing and Cre lox recombination. This ultimately culminates in the process of analyzing the effects of the gene knockout both in the short term and on a long term basis – depending on what the research study requires.</p><h2 id="""">What Does the Floxing Design Process Truly Entail?</h2><p id="""">The process of flox design and knocking out genes through the Cre-lox recombination process is fairly simple in theory. Floxing is the process of flanking a gene between two loxP sites in order to target it for knockout. This process of gene targeting is used in ES cells in order to support the development of otherwise healthy mouse models in which a specific, targeted gene is knocked out or deactivated through the use of Cre-lox recombination. Researchers can then study the mouse to find out specifically what the effects of the knockout are, what disorders or developmental issues are caused due to the lack of activity of that particular gene, and why the gene plays a role in creating those issues.</p><h2 id="""">The Benefits of Floxing and Knockout Mice</h2><p id="""">There are numerous benefits to using an effective flox design in order to produce knockout genes. One of them is that genes that could be fatal if deactivated can be safely analyzed without any risks to human patients. The mice that take part in the experiment are genetically similar enough to humans in order to ensure that scientists are able to come up with viable results that may ultimately be put to use in creating drugs and treatments.</p><h2 id="""">What Makes the Cre-lox Recombination Process Easier?</h2><p id="""">Once the flox design is obtained by flanking a gene segment between two loxP sites, the process of Cre-mediated recombination is somewhat more complex in practice than in theory. It involves conditional mutant mice that are obtained through crossing the floxed strain with a transgenic line. This action has the purpose of generating the knockout in vivo with the use of Cre. What makes the process easier and more manageable is the fact that there have been many transgenic lines generated over the years. Today it’s very easy to find the correct line that would support most studies based on tissue-specific conditional knockouts.</p><h2 id="""">A Promising View of Cre Lox and Floxing</h2><p id="""">The Cre-mediated recombination process combined with floxing can lead to excellent results, whether the purpose is to study the development of cancerous tumors in specific tissues or the progression of genetic diseases that are rare, but can be quite dangerous or even fatal. Proper flox design and Cre-lox recombination research are an important part of developing treatments that could help people lead better and healthier lives in the near future.</p><p>‍</p>",

Flox sequences, for instance, are DNA sequences that are flanked by LoxP sites for the purpose of targeting the genetic sequence in question with the Cre-lox recombination system. This system is one of the most well-designed and useful methods for genetic manipulation, which uses the Cre enzyme to target floxed sequences and either delete, translocate or invert the gene.</p><h3 id="""">Flox Sequences – Flanked by LoxP</h3><p id="""">A flox sequence is obtained by inserting loxP sites on both sides of a gene to target it most typically for deletion, as part of the process of creating a knockout gene. Depending on the loxP sites’ orientation, the use of two loxP sites with the same orientation will lead to the excision of the gene, while opposite orientations will cause inversion. Flox sequences allow for the complete removal of the gene, but partial deletion is also possible. The incomplete deletion of Cre-mediated excisions has been found to lead to phenotype differences that can be used to study a variety of unusual genetic changes that can occur in the case of some diseases.</p><h3 id="""">Targeting Sequences in ES Cells</h3><p id="""">A flox sequence is obtained and targeted through mouse ES cells. Laboratory mice are used because their genome presents genetic researchers with a unique opportunity to study a mammal whose genetic code is similar to humans, but is also small and easy to work with to obtain data. The Cre-lox process allows for the targeting and floxing of a specific gene within the ES cells of a mouse. The gene is then subsequently deleted or inverted, depending on what the experiment might require. The gene is targeted through floxing, and the process of flanking the gene by specific LoxP sites is usually completed using homologous recombination of a targeting vector in the mouse’s ES cells, often deleting the entire gene to obtain a null mutation.</p><h3 id="""">Floxed Mice and the Cre-lox System</h3><p id="""">Once a flox sequence is obtained, the Cre-lox recombination method is used to target that sequence and either completely remove it, invert it, or make a unique change that precisely manipulates the genome of the mouse. Some methods can include the gradual inactivation of the gene over time, triggering its deletion by a certain event that would occur in the mouse’s development, or the specific targeting of ES cells that would only be used in some of the mouse’s tissues or organs, such as the skin or the heart, in order to study tissue-specific gene inactivation.</p><h3 id="""">Further Progress with Floxed Genes</h3><p id="""">Floxed genes and the Cre-lox system can be very efficient when it comes to facilitating the study of various genetic changes, disorders and developmental impairments. However, the Cre-lox process is by no means perfect, and further research and progress are needed to obtain better results. Because there’s still not enough knowledge about usable insertion sites and the use of hemizygous mice to produce a certain flox sequence, the results can still be uncertain, leading many researchers to conclude that homozygous mice should be used to a greater extent for the time being.</p><p id="""">‍</p>",

This option is prevalent in the case of Vasa-Cre strains, where the Cre mRNA protein is expressed even when the transgene is not present within the oocyte.

This technique was created as a type of site-specific recombination process in order to delete or activate loxP-flanked DNA sequences. It is mainly used to define the roles of various genes and determine how they behave and how they can be influenced in relation to various genetic disorders and genetically influenced health complications.</p><h3 id="""">The Early Days of Cre Recombination</h3><p id="""">Floxed mice, Cre recombination experts believe, have the best chance at offering relevant and useful data that can be adapted to human research later on. This is why they are the main types of animals used in experiments involving the loxP flanking of chromosomal DNA sequences. At first, site-specific recombination was used by Dr. Brian Sauer in his experiments to show it’s possible to activate specific gene expression in mammalian cell lines. Later, Dr. Jamey Marth demonstrated that Cre-lox could also be used on specific cell types, to define endogenous gene functions and determine the roles that genetic lesions played in various diseases.</p><h3 id="""">The History and Significance of Cre-Lox</h3><p id="""">In 1994, Drs. Marth and Rajewsky discovered that the Cre-lox system could be used for conditional gene targeting. Together with the work of Joe Z. Tsien, who came up with ways of applying Cre-lox to cells and region-specific genes for manipulation purposes, they pioneered the widespread use of conditional mutagenesis throughout the growing world of genetic research. Although Cre-lox recombination is a method developed less than 30 years ago and may seem relatively new, that is seen as quite a long period in the world of genetic research. Despite this, Cre-lox recombination is still regarded as a very precise method used for specific gene targeting.</p><h3 id="""">The Significance of Floxed Mice</h3><p id="""">When it comes to discussing floxed mice, Cre lox recombination techniques are often mentioned in the same sentence. This is because floxed mice, or mice with cells that bear a targeted loxP-flanked (also known as floxed) polymerase gene, are essential to ensure that the technique actually functions as intended. In Cre-lox recombination, the floxed gene is used to pinpoint the precise gene targeted for the recombination process. Once flanked at the short target DNA sequences known as the lox sequences, the piece of genetic material that is meant to be deleted, inverted, translocated or inserted can then interact with the Cre recombinase enzyme for recombination to occur.</p><h3 id="""">How Floxed Mice Are Used</h3><p id="""">With the help of floxed mice, Cre lox recombination processes can be applied to splice snippets of DNA in ES cells in order to generate mice with specific genetic enhancements or detriments. Genes can not only be added, deleted or inverted, but they can also be partially inactivated for the purpose of studying how a faulty gene might impact the health and development of an animal model with DNA similar to that of a human. Modern advancements have taken the process to the next level, continuing to use floxed mice, Cre recombination techniques and new technologies that obtain accurate data more quickly than before.</p><p id="""">‍</p>",

In most cases, gene targeting with the use of floxing is enhanced and catalyzed through a process known as <strong id="""">Cre/lox recombination</strong>. This can lead to the production of appropriate genetic models for the study of various genetic diseases, as well as diseases that can be triggered by the mutation or inactivation of a certain gene. Many studies have shown the effectiveness of using floxed animal models – especially mouse models – in order to obtain conditional, tissue-specific modifications as well as the alteration of various gene expressions.</p><p id="""">In essence, through the use of floxing and Cre recombinase, it is possible to splice a gene entirely out of the genome, invert the orientation of the gene by removing it and splicing it back in with the opposite orientation, and replace the gene with a floxed DNA sequence that originated elsewhere. All of these options are available once Cre recombinase is expressed and becomes active within a cell with a floxed gene.</p><h3 id="""">The Main Advantages of Gene Floxing</h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">One of the greatest advantages of floxing is that it allows for detailed in vivo study of abnormalities and diseases associated with genetic modifications</strong>. During the development of floxed mouse models, gene knockouts and other alterations can be triggered by certain processes at specific times. This action is made possible by the use of floxing together with the Cre/lox recombination system, allowing for the generation of better, more precise animal models. The development of drugs and genetic treatments can be highly dependent on new breakthroughs and results that are found during the in vivo study of floxed mouse models. Better models can accelerate this process, as they allow researchers to obtain more accurate and practical results.</p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image "" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""""><div><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/665dc660af52559c0ed6ec8b/667b2acb44f58580d203e612_Downloadable-Icon-min.png"" alt="""" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto"" id=""""></div></figure><p id="""">Download Our <strong id="""">Free</strong> Conditional Knockout (cKO) Quick Guide</p><p id=""""><a href=""http://go.genetargeting.com/conditional-ko-quick-guide"" target=""_blank"" id=""""><strong id="""">GET YOUR COPY</strong></a></p><p id="""">Tissue-specific knockouts using Cre/lox recombination and floxed mice can prevent many of the problems that occur during conventional knockout mutations. These can include serious concerns such as increased embryonic lethality and unwanted inconsistencies in the gene knockout process. As a result, whenever greater accuracy or a tissue-specific recombination is needed, most experts will recommend the use of floxed mouse models that have the gene in question inactivated only in a specific type of tissue, such as the kidneys or liver.</p><p id="""">Other uses for the site-specific recombinase system using gene floxing can also include conditional gene trapping, the creation of a multipurpose conditional allele and the ability to facilitate more accurate methods for gene silencing. All these uses come with their own advantages, including the reduction of embryo lethality in the case of gene trapping studies and the possibility to induce gene silencing in less time, compared to conventional methods.</p><p id="""">In summary, gene floxing is powerful in today’s research laboratories as it allows precise and discrete analysis of gene function. Its use in animal biology will better allow us to delineate the exact role of multiple cell types and at varying times throughout the lifespan of an animal. For example, using gene floxing with the alpha-MyHC promoter causes the floxed gene to be inactivated in the heart alone. Further, these knockouts can be inducible. In several mouse studies, tamoxifen is used to induce the Cre recombinase. In this case, Cre recombinase is fused to a portion of the mouse estrogen receptor which contains a mutation within its ligand binding domain. The mutation renders the receptor inactive, which leads to incorrect localization through its interactions with chaperone proteins such as heat shock protein. Tamoxifen binds to Cre-ER and disrupts its interactions with the chaperones, which allows the Cre-ER fusion protein to enter the nucleus and perform recombination on the floxed gene. Thus, this genetic resource is available to continue the remarkable progress made recently in understanding how certain genes function to regulate development and signaling activities.</p><p id=""""><a href=""https://go.genetargeting.com/subscribe-to-ingenious?_ga=2.27283196.172984620.1689620143-1619993392.1680271047"" target=""_blank"" id=""""><strong id="""">SUBSCRIBE TO OUR NEWSLETTER</strong></a></p><p>‍</p>",

Cre recombines the loxP sites, creating a tissue-specific knockout of your gene of interest. The system is straightforward, reliable and there are many Cre lines now available to choose from for your studies. However, sometimes you require more than just tissue-specific control of your animal model for your experiments. In this blog we describe two inducible systems which add new options for your animal model by providing temporal control.</p><h3 id="""">Drug-inducible Cre recombinase system</h3><p id="""">As soon as Cre is expressed in the cell, it moves into the nucleus and recombines loxP sites, creating a gene knockout. When Cre is driven by a tissue-specific promoter, knockout will occur in those specific tissue cells. However you may want timed control over your tissue-specific animal model as well in order to expand your experiments. This is possible by using an inducible system called Cre-ERT. With this system, Cre is fused to a mutated ligand-binding domain from the estrogen receptor (ER). Cre-ERT is expressed as normal but is unable to bind DNA in the nucleus because it is sequestered in the cytoplasm. &nbsp;Cre becomes localized to the nucleus only when synthetic steroid, such as Tamoxifen, is present. The Cre-ERT system can be tissue-specific, just like Cre, and has inducible control because Cre-ERT waits for the drug to be administered in order to become active. Just as with the Cre-lox system, you need two lines in order to achieve knockout: The Cre-ERT mouse line and your floxed mouse line (that you can also use with standard Cre for comparison). The limitations with using Cre-ERT when compared to Cre alone are similar, e.g. you will need to demonstrate that the knockout is occurring where and when you think it is. Otherwise the systems are comparable and the only difference is the administration of the drug, which can occur by injection or ingestion. The Cre-ERT systems has been improved to make it more sensitive to the drug and in this case you may find lines called Cre-ERT2 available from collaborators or in a repository.</p><h3 id="""">Inducible transgene expression with Tet-ON systems</h3><p id="""">Cre-ERT2 is a way to have inducible knockout but what if you want inducible activation of your cDNA? The Tet-ON system is used to provide inducible activation of a target cDNA in the presence of a drug such as Dox. &nbsp;More specifically, the Tet-ON system utilizes a mutated transactivator called reverse tTA (rtTA). In this system the presence of Dox allows the system to be turned on and your cDNA to be expressed. Two mouse lines are required for this to work: A tissue-specific rtTA-expressing mouse line and a second mouse line with a specific DNA element (TRE) driving your cDNA. &nbsp;Dox can be added to food or drinking water to activate your cDNA. Take away Dox to return to normal.</p><p id="""">Tissue-specific control of this system can get tricky because limited tissue-specific rtTA lines exist. In order to address this, <strong id="""">ingenious</strong> has created its Inducible Rosa-Express™ system where only two mouse lines are required and tissue specificity is provided by one of the many Cre lines available. By designing a mouse line that contains a floxed stop cassette and all of the necessary Tet-On control components, we enable tissue-specificity and inducibility of your cDNA without the need for transactivator lines. Simply mate our Inducible Rosa-Express™ line containing your specific cDNA to one of the tissue-specific Cre recombinase mouse lines that you probably already have in your mouse room and introduce Dox for inducible activation of your cDNA in your tissue of interest.</p><h4 id=""""><em id="""">References</em></h4><ul id=""""><li id="""">Elefteriou F1, Yang X. 2011. <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3331798/"" target=""_blank"" id=""""><strong id="""">Genetic mouse models for bone studies—Strengths and limitations.</strong></a> <em id="""">Bone</em> <strong id="""">49</strong>(6):1242-54.</li><li id=""""><a href=""https://www.jax.org/news-and-insights/jax-blog/2014/december/the-abcs-of-choosing-a-cre-strain-to-generate-ko-mice"" target=""_blank"" id=""""><strong id="""">The ABC’s of choosing a Cre strain to generate KO mice</strong></a></li><li id="""">Zhong ZA1, Sun W1, Chen H1, Zhang H2, Lay YE1, Lane NE1, Yao W3. 2015. <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4640982/"" target=""_blank"" id=""""><strong id="""">Optimizing tamoxifen-inducible Cre/loxp system to reduce tamoxifen effect on bone turnover in long bones of young mice.</strong></a> <em id="""">Bone</em> <strong id="""">81</strong>:614-619.</li></ul><p id="""">‍</p>",

Typically used on mice, it involves a number of complex processes and methods that can be used for facilitating the inactivation of a gene. Whether we’re talking about conditional or regular gene knockouts, or about advanced methods such as CRISPR/Cas9 and TALENs, the method can be considered one of the most effective when it comes to the study of human disease.</p><h3 id="""">Understanding the Essentials of Gene Knockout</h3><p id="""">Some techniques for manipulating genes are used to modify or add genetic material to the genome of a certain organism. Others are used to remove or deactivate certain genes. The gene knockout is a method that falls under the latter category. It typically involves the use of an animal model such as a laboratory mouse (also known as a knockout mouse) and a tool such as zinc fingers, homologous recombination, or the CRISPR/Cas9 technique for obtaining knockouts. There are different types of knockouts depending on the type of gene that’s being targeted, the conditions involved with the method, or the number of knockout genes. Double, triple and even quadruple knockouts are all possible. One also has to distinguish between homozygous and heterozygous knockouts.</p><h3 id="""">Who Does Research on Gene Knockouts?</h3><p id="""">Knocking out genes in the mammalian genome has been done for quite a few years, and the methods involved are being perfected to an increasing extent almost on a yearly basis. Today there are countless universities and scientific institutions, as well as amateurs, who attempt to create new KOs using established gene knockout methods. Recently, the International Knockout Mouse Consortium has expressed the goal to knock out every single gene in the mouse genome, and they have already started. A recent paper published by Karen Svenson, Robert Braun and Stephen Murray has already documented the detailed analysis of the first 3,328 genes.</p><h3 id="""">What Happens When We Knock Out a Gene?</h3><p id="""">A gene knockout is essentially a tool that’s used in order to help researchers understand the role of a specific gene or a certain portion of DNA. By “knocking out” or deactivating a certain gene, the method allows scientists to study the process by which disease sets in as a result of the deactivation or impairment of certain genes. When the gene is knocked out, the organism starts exhibiting symptoms resulting from gene impairment. Researchers then have the opportunity to use various methods designed to solve the problem. Knockouts are, therefore, frequently used as disease models that help geneticists better understand the origins of certain diseases.</p><h3 id="""">Knockouts and Human Diseases</h3><p id="""">Our understanding of human health and disease has been advanced exponentially since knockouts began appearing on the scene. The first gene knockout was developed more than 30 years ago, and the process is still being perfected today. Since then, countless genetic models of human disease have been developed through humanized mice and research conducted directly on embryonic stem cells. Whether naturally occurring or a result of laboratory tests, humanized knockout mice have become an important tool for studying genetic diseases like Krabbe disease and muscular dystrophy. They’re also used in studying cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer’s and many other well-known disorders that can be linked to genetics, but only develop under certain circumstances.</p><h3 id="""">Knockout Mice and Their Important Role</h3><p id="""">With the aid of knockout mice, genetic researchers have not only made significant breakthroughs in understanding the onset of certain diseases, but in treating them as well. Humanized mice help to avoid the need to use human subjects in studies that would normally be dangerous or unethical. Moreover, with the help of humanized mice, researchers are better able to understand the function of genes as they relate to each other. As a result, the use of a single or multiple gene knockout can often lead to unparalleled discoveries that would normally be difficult to attain.</p><p id="""">‍</p>",

Gene knockouts are often targeted towards specific genes and mutations that are meant to achieve a certain genetic change that can later be passed down through generations of gene knockout models. As we will see, there are numerous techniques and approaches designed to maximize the efficiency of the gene knockout method and facilitate a more straightforward path toward studying gene function in great detail.</p><h3 id="""">An Overview of the Gene Knockout</h3><p id="""">In gene knockouts, an organism’s genetic makeup is altered by rendering one or more genes inactive (as the name suggests, “knocked out”). The term “knockout” can refer to the specific gene or to the organism itself. Because of the similarity between human and mouse DNA, by investigating the aftereffects of the loss of a specific gene in mice, scientists are able to extrapolate how the loss or damage of that gene in humans can affect the normal functioning of the human body. Researchers consider the knockout technique to be the opposite of the gene knockin method, which involves the addition of a gene. There are also double, triple and even quadruple knockouts, when multiple genes are eliminated from the body’s natural make up.</p><h3 id="""">The Conditional Knockout Method</h3><p id="""">The conditional gene knockout method is one of the more special KO methods used by scientists today. It involves gene deletion through a specialized system that can remove the gene based on tissue and/or time-specific criteria. This is an extremely useful innovation that scientists continue to use in studying genes and how they function in normal physiology as well as in disease. To achieve conditional gene knockout, IoxP sequences are introduced around the targeted gene to trigger a viral enzyme known as Cre recombinase, which is able to recombine the sequences and delete the gene found between them.</p><h3 id="""">Gene Knockout Techniques, Cognition and Memory Enhancement</h3><p id="""">The gene knockout method has numerous potential applications, from studying the effects of genetically induced diseases, to understanding the impact that the deactivation of a certain gene or group of genes can have on the body and on various areas of the brain that have to do with memory and learning. In these cases, the use of specific knockout methods has led to the more accurate study of nuclear signaling and synaptic activities that has laid the foundation for a new field in neuroscience known as molecular and cellular cognition.</p><h3 id="""">Further Advancements and Simplified Knockout Methods</h3><p id="""">Scientists tasked with perfecting the knockout method are aiming towards increasingly simplified techniques and processes that show quicker results. One such process was discovered along with the use of <em id="""">Paenibacillus polymyxa</em>, a special bacteria with the ability to support nitrogen fixation and produce a number of important active biological components. The new knockout system is designed to help researchers understand the bacterium with greater ease, through a system that’s based on marker exchange mutagenesis directly targeting its main competent cells in order to mediate the deletion and substitution of α-and β-amylase genes. This simple system is an example of the advancements scientists have achieved since the initial inception of the gene knockout method.</p><p>‍</p>",

Depending on the condition being studied, researchers were at one time limited to available species that could naturally match the course of <a href=""https://genetargeting.com/"" target=""_blank"" id="""">disease progression</a>. This severely impacted the scope of research studies, especially if the animals required to model human disease, such as the pig, were large and/or expensive to house. The ability to genetically alter animal models became available in the 1980s and largely eliminated this potential limitation. Finally, research teams could successfully engineer animal models that better mimicked human disease in systems that were much easier to manage and maintain. The mouse, for example, is now the most popular animal model among researchers because they multiply quickly, have short lifespans of about one year, and are less expensive to house in research facilities compared to larger animal models. With this, researchers were able to better understand the pathology of human disease and more reliably translate that research into new therapies by genetically humanizing animal models, or making model organism physiology more like a human by incorporating <a href=""https://genetargeting.com/gene-replacement/"" target=""_blank"" id="""">functioning human genes</a> into the mouse.</p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image "" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""""><div><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/665dc660af52559c0ed6ec8b/667b98885584ed98256c8df6_HumanizedMouse_Color-e1647634102440-680x326-1.png"" alt="""" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto"" id=""""></div></figure><p id="""">Historically, genetic humanization of model organisms was achieved through one of two methods: random insertion transgenic humanization and targeted genomic humanization. Random insertion transgenic humanization technology for the mouse was introduced in the 1980s and allowed researchers to randomly insert human genetic material, which could include an entire gene and its promoter, into the mouse genome. While this method is relatively fast and low cost, it has several disadvantages, including:</p><ul id=""""><li id="""">the potential insertion of transgenes in multiple locations and copies in the mouse genome,</li><li id="""">the required segregation of transgenes to a single allele through breeding, and</li><li id="""">the possible disruption of mouse genes near the transgene insertion site(s).</li></ul><p id="""">In contrast, targeted genomic humanization removes much of the uncertainty associated with random insertion of human transgenes by inserting a single copy of a transgene at a desired location in the host. The process is more complex, expensive, and time consuming, but the transgene insertion is predictable and results in easier breeding. This strategy is typically used to replace the first exon of a mouse gene with the corresponding cDNA of a human gene, simultaneously inactivating the mouse gene and introducing the human gene for expression driven by the existing mouse promoter. The primary disadvantage of this method is its artificiality of regulation: any pre-mRNA splicing regulation that may have occurred in the human gene is lost and 3’ UTRs are typically not included in transgenes.</p><p id="""">In order to eliminate the limitations of current genetic humanization methods in mice, ingenious targeting laboratory developed its TruHumanizationTM technology to provide fast, targeted, single-step insertion of human transgenes of up to 200kb into the mouse genome. This allows researchers to insert all of the regulatory sequence they require—including full and partial genes, promoters, introns, miRNA regulatory sites, and UTRs—to drive expression of the desired human transgene in a mouse model. Using our TruHumanizationTM technology, a research group recently created a transgenic mouse strain that replaced the entire murine Mapt (microtubule-associated protein tau) gene with the human ortholog for Alzheimer’s disease studies. Importantly, the MAPT knockin mice expressed all six human tau isoforms, and the researchers discovered greater interaction between pathological human tau and human tau compared to murine tau, highlighting the importance of humanizing tau protein in mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease.1</p><p id="""">Genetically humanized mouse models are already making preclinical research studies more translational. &nbsp;For example, mouse models that genetically replace the murine Ace2 gene with the human ACE2 ortholog, facilitating SARS-CoV-2 infection, are currently being used to characterize the pathology of COVID-19.<sup id="""">2</sup> ingenious targeting laboratory created its own large-scale <a href=""https://genetargeting.com/humanized-ace2-mouse/"" id="""">humanized ACE2 mouse model</a>, <a href=""https://genetargeting.com/humanized-ace2-mouse/"" id="""">huACE2-ingenL</a>, to help researchers study the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.

In recent years, with advancements in technology and the development of more advanced methods, the science has become available for transgenic facilities to streamline the knockout mouse process.</p><p id="""">Creating knockout mice can involve different methods and technologies, such as <strong id="""">CRISPR and ES cells</strong>, for producing the desired gene knockout outcome. Each approach has its own unique advantages depending on the goals of the knockout mouse to be studied.</p><h2 id=""""><strong id="""">Which techniques are commonly used for gene knockout in mice?</strong></h2><h4 id="""">Gene Targeting – A Method for Creating a Knockout Mouse Using ES Cells</h4><p id="""">How a knockout mouse is made depends on the method used for mutating the mouse gene of study. The homologous recombination process is a robust method researchers can use that allows for specific gene targeting of large genomic regions. This method involves the introduction of an artificial gene sequence that is directly targeted to the specific gene sequence of interest by way of a homologous recombination vector, thus the term “homologous recombination.” The homologous sequences in the vector are positioned to flank the existing gene on both sides (“upstream” and “downstream”). In the ES cell, the cellular process of homologous recombination takes over, identifying the matching parts of the sequence and supporting replacement of the original piece of DNA with the engineered artificial gene sequence, hence knocking out the wild type gene.</p><h4 id="""">Utilizing CRISPR/Cas9 Technology to Make a Knockout Mouse Model</h4><p id="""">The CRISPR genome editing system is a RNA-guided endonucleases system allowing users to design gRNA which will target small DNA sequences of interest. In the presence of Cas9 endonuclease, the gRNA directs Cas9 to unwind and cleave the double stranded DNA at a specific location. For the generation of knockout alleles, the microinjection of a single guide RNA in zygotes is sufficient to create indels in a critical exon of choice, inducing a frameshift mutation and therefore functionally abolishing the gene of interest.</p><p id="""">The emergence of CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology has considerably improved the time frame and the process of creating these modified alleles. In particular, this revolutionary technology has enabled rapid production of knockout mice or mice carrying a single point mutation, which mimic those in human patients.</p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-video "" style=""padding-bottom:33.75%"" data-rt-type=""video"" data-rt-align="""" data-rt-max-height=""33.75%""><div id=""""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/nd_Dj-FOvW0?feature=oembed"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen=""""></iframe></div></figure><h2 id=""""><strong id="""">What is a knockout mouse?</strong></h2><p id="""">A knockout mouse is an animal model in which a gene of interest is disrupted or inactivated. The goal of making knockout mice is to completely deactivate a certain gene in order to study its effect on the body. Without the gene, certain physiological functions may be impaired, which can give insight into the development of various diseases. This allows researchers to find ways to counteract such problems and symptoms, and then use that data to develop new treatments for human diseases.</p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image "" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""""><div id=""""><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/665dc660af52559c0ed6ec8b/667b2acb44f58580d203e612_Downloadable-Icon-min.png"" alt="""" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto"" id=""""></div></figure><p id="""">Download Our <strong id="""">Free</strong> Conditional Knockout (cKO) Quick Guide</p><p id=""""><a href=""http://go.genetargeting.com/conditional-ko-quick-guide"" target=""_blank"" id=""""><strong id="""">GET YOUR COPY</strong></a></p><h2 id=""""><strong id="""">How are gene knockouts done?</strong></h2><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Knockout Mice Utilizing ES Cells:</strong></h3><h4 id="""">Designing and Inserting a Targeting Vector</h4><p id="""">When making knockout mice, the first and most important step is designing a vector that will direct replacement at your specific gene location of interest. Upon identifying a good place to target your gene, a vector is made containing complementary genomic sequences and markers such as neo and TK that, once inserted into your gene by homologous recombination, will create the gene knockout. The vector is then inserted into ES cells through electroporation.</p><h4 id="""">Identifying Cells that Contain the Knockout Gene</h4><p id="""">Once the targeting vector is electroporated into ES cells, a screening process is initiated to identify clones that underwent proper homologous recombination. To separate the correctly targeted cells from those that have to be discarded, researchers will use the drug-resistant marker from the vector to narrow down properly targeted cells. PCR analysis will further confirm proper targeting, leading to one copy of the gene being knocked out in those cells.</p><h4 id="""">Generating a Chimeric Mouse</h4><p id="""">Once the right cells are prepared, it’s time to inject them into the blastocyst that will become the target chimeric mouse. The ES cells will typically be transplanted into the healthy blastocyst contained inside the uterus of a white mouse. This is an efficient method for making knockout mice, since the resulting mouse will have white and dark patches, making it easily identifiable as a chimera.</p><h4 id="""">Breeding Chimeric Mice</h4><p id="""">Once the chimeric mouse is successfully generated, the final process is to validate and breed it. The chimeric mouse will normally be bred with a normal, black mouse, in order to pass down the altered genetic material to its offspring. Typically, if the experiment is successful, the resulting mice will have a normal version of the knockout gene from their mother and a knocked out version of the gene resulting from their father. These results will become apparent when performing DNA sequencing on the gene in question. By regularly making knockout mice, it’s possible to become more proficient, learn better techniques for targeting genes more successfully, and more.</p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image "" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""""><a href=""https://genetargeting.com/knockout-mouse-models/"" target=""_blank"" id=""""><div id=""""><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/665dc660af52559c0ed6ec8b/667b965d327acd15569bf63f_Custom-Knockout-Mice-CTA-min.jpeg"" alt="""" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto"" id=""""></div></a></figure><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Knockout Mice Using CRISPR:</strong></h3><h4 id="""">Targeting Material Design and Creation</h4><p id="""">There are online tools available that simplify the design process if you’re making a straight forward model with the CRISPR/Cas9 method, and then reagents can easily be ordered through a provider company.</p><h4 id="""">Embryo Injection / Electroporation</h4><p id="""">Various methods, such as electroporation, are available for delivering Cas9 and your targeting materials into embryos. Foster mothers are then used for implantation of the embryos.</p><h4 id="""">Screen Potential Founders</h4><p id="""">Genome editing efficiency via CRISPR/Cas9 can widely vary. A founder mouse that contains viable and properly targeted germ cells in needed in order to successfully create a new line. Genotyping is typically done by looking at DNA from the tail or ear. However, a positive genotyping result from these tissues does not conclusively show that a founder mouse can pass on the mutation. In this case, generating and testing multiple founders is necessary.</p><h4 id="""">Breeding F1s</h4><p id="""">Once you have multiple founders, they are set up to breed with wild-type mice and the offspring are genotyped. The specific mutation in each founder can possibly be different due to mosaicism and so it is strongly recommended that F1 mice from different founders be treated as completely separate lines, as the specific mutation can have different expression levels. Validating each founder’s offspring independently can help you decide which mice to move forward with.</p><h4 id="""">Validation</h4><p id="""">Sequencing the mutation site as well as around the mutation site is important for validating the model as well as ensuring no unwanted rearrangements or deletions occurred, which is possible with the CRISPR technology. Then, functional studies can be conducted to show that, for example, the mutation did in fact disrupted gene expression.</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">How Knockout Mice Differ from Knockin Mice</strong></h3><p id="""">Knockout and knockin mice might seem similar in that they are both genetically modified animal models, but their purposes are generally different.

Successfully creating a knock-in mouse model is considered a somewhat more difficult feat than that of generating knockout mice, despite the many different methods and scopes that are associated with the former. That being said, the differences between gene knockout and gene knock-in technologies are clearly defined and quite extensive. Knockout technologies use other tools aimed at deleting certain sections of the DNA sequence and targeting it as accurately as possible. Knock-ins, however, must be even more accurate due to the fact that they are designed to replace the information contained at a specific locus within the DNA sequence, or to add sequence information that cannot be found in that particular locus.</p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image "" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""""><div><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/665dc660af52559c0ed6ec8b/667b2acb44f58580d203e612_Downloadable-Icon-min.png"" alt="""" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto"" id=""""></div></figure><p id=""""><strong id="""">Free Mouse Model Generation Guide:</strong> Step-by-step process for creating new custom models</p><p id=""""><a href=""https://genetargeting.com/mouse-model-generation-guide/"" target=""_blank"" id=""""><strong id="""">LEARN MORE</strong></a></p><p id="""">There are many possible uses and protocols associated with generating a knock-in mouse. All methods of creating knock-in mice are designed to introduce an exogenous gene that typically has the function to break or modify endogenous genes in order to generate some sort of changes in the body at a genetic level. There are many types and uses for knock-in genes. One of them is the conventional knock-in mouse in which single or multiple point mutations are engineered or targeting your gene of interest with a cassette insertion to express an alternate sequence. Another option is to use the Cre/loxP system to generate an inducible gene expression, which is considered one of the most common methods of generating knock-in mice. The Rosa26 locus is also of paramount importance, as it can be used to generate ubiquitous gene expressions and a unique gene expression strategy. When the goal is to investigate the expression pattern of the gene and common methods might be difficult, there are other strategies that can be used. Combining with reporter proteins like mcherry and GFP, for example, is one of the best ways to achieve that goal. According to most experts, the production of knock-in mice is what typically requires the most advanced technology and research.</p><p id="""">The process of generating a knock-in mouse is as elaborate as that of generating mouse knockouts. One of the most common methods of achieving this goal is through the use of homologous recombination. For that purpose, the production work must first involve the creation of a targeting vector, which is then electroporated into ES cells. Drug-resistant ES cell clones are identified and isolated, and then PCR screening is used on the homologous recombinant. After that, establishing recombinant ES clones will have to be properly supported through the production of chimeric mice and heterozygous mice. The production of F1 heterozygous mice is usually the last step in the process, requiring the mice to later be crossed and re-crossed with wild type mice, in order to remove the FLP or Cre transgene.</p><p id="""">The possible applications of knock in mice and the knock in process in general are hard to fully estimate. For example, the knock in of human immunoglobin genes into mouse tissue has already proven its effectiveness. Another example is the modification of stem cells in humans for the purpose of achieving goals such as the correction of mutant gamma chain genes in hematopoietic stem cells. In conclusion, generating knockin mouse models is one of the most pressing research projects that scientists all around the world are trying to accomplish.</p><p>‍</p>",

Transgenic mice – primarily in the form of knockout mice – are an integral part of the research of diseases such as obesity, heart disease and Parkinson’s disease. They are also used to understand gene function and its effect on basic, physiological functions of the mammalian body.</p><h3 id="""">A Quick Introduction to Transgenic Mice</h3><p id="""">Transgenic mice are genetically modified animals that involve the transfer of a type of genetic material known as a transgene, from one animal to the other. The idea behind creating transgenic mice is isolating a DNA sequence that contains a gene and extracting it for the purpose of introducing it into a different organism. This exchange is typically done from one mouse blastocyst to the other. In many cases, researchers opt to add a certain modification to the transgene, turning the resulting mouse model into a knockout mouse or a more specialized mouse, called an oncomouse. Learning how to make a transgenic mouse can take a lot of work, and the use of transgenes should be emphasized and understood before attempting anything more complex.</p><h3 id="""">Transgene Use in Plants and Animals</h3><p id="""">The fact that transgenic specimens can be found naturally occurring throughout the natural world is no surprise. In fact, it has been something that scientists knew for many years. Naturally and genetically modified transgenic plants are being used on a regular basis to create GMO foods for increasing crops. Some examples include corn, cotton, rice, rapeseed and soybeans. Also, learning how to make a transgenic mouse is not the only way to modify the genetic structure of an animal using a transgene. Scientists have successfully devised methods of generating transgenic sheep and chicken models, and a great deal of research was focused on the transgenic alteration of Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly) DNA.</p><h3 id="""">A Short Overview of the Steps to Create Transgenic Mice</h3><p id="""">Learning how to make a transgenic mouse is deceptively simple. There are many elements in the procedure to generate transgenic mice that must be done carefully to obtain the desired results. To start the process of creating a transgenic mouse, one needs to introduce exogenous coding sequences of DNA into the mouse genome, conferring Mendelian inheritable traits. Specifically, gene transfer in mice became possible through the physical introduction of DNA through microinjection of defined sequences into one or both pronuclei of zygote-stage embryos. Microinjected embryos were then surgically transferred into pseudopregnant recipient females where embryonic development proceeds unperturbed, yielding newborn mice approximately 20 days following the procedure. <a href=""https://genetargeting.com/transgenic-mouse-models/"" target=""_blank"" id="""">Targeted transgenic</a> lines require additional steps to create because the genetic modification is made in mouse embryonic stem cells. DNA containing the transgene sequence is introduced into the cells, then a large number of cells must be screened to find the ones where the transgene integrated into the correct position. Modified cells are used to create chimeric mice where some parts of the animal have the normal genetic sequence and some parts have the transgene.</p><h3 id="""">Important Recommendations for Preparing a Transgenic Mouse</h3><p id="""">Knowing how to make a transgenic mouse is not as easy as it sounds. All steps must be completed with the greatest of care and precision. Also, focusing on preparing clean samples of DNA will minimize the chance of an unhealthy embryo and inefficient DNA integration. Experts recommend for purified DNA to be dissolved in a microinjection buffer and centrifuged, to prevent the presence of impure particles.</p><h3 id="""">Knockin vs. Transgenic Mouse Models</h3><p id="""">The key difference is that knockin mouse models are targeted, meaning the desired gene is inserted into a specific locus in the target genome via homologous recombination. For instance, in Gene X knockin mice, the Gene X is located in exactly the locus where Gene X is always located in mice. This is important because it means the gene will achieve biological (i.e. natural) expression patterns and levels. By contrast, transgenic mouse models use random integration: the desired gene could end up anywhere in the host genome. The desired gene might be placed under its own (strong) promoter, leading to high levels of expression, which can be good for disease models, leading to an earlier or more robust phenotype. But the tradeoff is that it’s not as faithful a mouse model of the human disease. One possible issue is that the expression pattern might be all wrong.</p><p id="""">In either knockin mouse models or transgenic mouse models, the introduced gene can be from the same species or a different species. Just as transgenesis doesn’t necessarily involve a different species, knockin doesn’t necessarily imply the gene is from the same species.</p><p>‍</p>",

This model type has aided in studies across an incredible range of topics, from rare genetic diseases to fundamental biological processes. By combining tried-and-true methods with newly-developed techniques this type of mouse model will continue to be valuable for basic and applied research for the foreseeable future.</p><p id="""">The value of conditional knockout mice is clearer with an understanding of the components that go into making and using the models. Conditional knockout mice are used as part of a system that’s commonly referred to as “Cre-lox” which names the two elements that make it work. “Cre” is Cre recombinase, a DNA modifying enzyme originally derived from a virus. This enzyme seeks out DNA with a specific sequence known as a “lox” site. When two lox sites are close together the Cre enzyme can trigger a dramatic change in the DNA molecule. This reaction can be controlled by making small changes in the DNA sequence of the lox sites, so the Cre-lox system can be used to alter DNA in multiple ways. In the case of conditional knockout mouse models the goal is to have a specific gene function normally at first, then have Cre recombinase inactivate the gene at the right time.</p><p id="""">Using the Cre-lox system for conditional knockout requires the creation of at least one genetically modified mouse line. Two lox sequences must be carefully inserted into precise locations to create a “floxed” gene. Ideally the floxed gene will not be disrupted at all by the insertion of the lox sequences – they are placed in locations where a small change doesn’t have an effect. If no Cre recombinase is added then the floxed gene should function as normal and the mice should be healthy. However when Cre is added the power of the conditional knockout is revealed: Cre triggers a change in the DNA sequence that inactivates the floxed gene. This enables experiments to determine the function of the gene and understand what happens when it is inactivated. Furthermore a great degree of control is possible over Cre so a wide variety of experiments are possible.</p><p id="""">Conditional knockout mice have that name because the floxed gene can be knocked out specifically under certain conditions and this control is possible because Cre can be regulated in multiple ways. Often the genetically modified mouse line with a floxed gene is crossed to another line that expresses Cre only in certain cells in the animal, for example only in one organ. Cre triggers DNA changes that inactivate the floxed gene and since Cre is only active in certain cells the gene is conditionally knocked out in just those cells. Additional levels of control are possible by altering the Cre enzyme itself. One example is a modified Cre that only triggers DNA changes when a certain drug is added. With that additional level of control the floxed gene can be knocked out in certain cells and also the timing of knockout can be chosen. This level of control may be needed if the gene of interest is required for embryonic development for example. With genes like that an early knockout results in pups never being born, so precise control is required to make experiments possible.</p><p id="""">Every experiment using Cre-lox for conditional knockout must account for specific features of the floxed gene as well as regulation of Cre. Introducing lox sites into the genome should not affect the gene of interest and this must be carefully checked. Likewise Cre activity must be verified, for example to confirm that Cre is only active in the desired cells. With careful planning before any new mouse models are generated the conditional knockout strategy can make exciting new discoveries possible.</p><p id="""">‍</p>",conventional-vs-conditional-knockout

These mice are used to mimic human conditions and apply potential therapies more efficiently, without any of the risks involved with using human patients. The following discusses the various types of humanized mice and why they are so widely used by researchers worldwide.</p><h3 id="""">The Basics of Humanized Mouse Models</h3><p id="""">What are humanized mice? To put it simply, they are <strong id="""">animal models used as a type of surrogate of various parts of human biology</strong>, such as the human immune system. Some humanized mice may only have human cells, while others might share many genetic and physiologic properties with humans. Because the mouse genome is close in similarity to that of humans, there are many components of mouse biology and genetics that can easily be manipulated to faithfully mimic human biological qualities.</p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image "" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""""><a href=""https://genetargeting.com/humanized-mouse-models/"" target=""_blank""><div><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/665dc660af52559c0ed6ec8b/667b97ec327acd15569ce7a6_Custom-Humanized-Mice-CTA.jpeg"" alt="""" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto"" id=""""></div></a></figure><h3 id="""">How Are Humanized Mice Made?</h3><p id="""">When using humanized mice in scientific research, there is no universal method or technology when it comes to how to generate humanized mice. Basically, there are three main model types to choose from: tumor, immune system, and gene targeted.</p><h3 id="""">Tumor Mouse Models</h3><p id="""">In the case of a tumor model, immunodeficient mice, or mice lacking a mouse immune system, can be transplanted with human tumor cells or tissue. Scientists will utilize this type of mouse model in order to study a wide variety of conditions and diseases <em id="""">in vivo</em>.</p><h4 id="""">Types of Immunodeficient Mouse Models</h4><p id="""">Immunodeficient mouse models are used for a variety of applications in biomedical research. Whether researchers are grafting human tumor cells into or creating a partially functional human immune system<a href=""https://genetargeting.com/humanized/humanized-mice/#_ftn1"" id=""""><sup id="""">[1]</sup></a> in a live mouse, many experimental studies require a severely attenuated host immune response. Three mouse strains we will discuss here, NOD, NSG, and nude, are commonly leveraged in cancer, precision medicine, infectious disease, HIV, immune system, and vaccination research studies for their various immune system defects.</p><h4 id="""">NOD Mice</h4><p id="""">The NOD/ShiLtJ strain of non-obese diabetic (NOD) immunodeficient mice is susceptible to type 1 (autoimmune) diabetes and is commonly used as a polygenic model organism for the disease. This strain exhibits a decreased innate immune response with lower than average numbers of immune cells, including natural killer (NK) cells, macrophages, and antigen presenting cells (APC), and low hemolytic complement activity. NOD is also commonly used as a background for immunodeficient mouse strains and in autoimmunity and tolerance research. When NOD is used as the background strain for severe combined immunodeficiency (<em id="""">scid</em>) mice that are homozygous recessive for the <em id="""">Prkdc<sup id="""">scid</sup></em> allele, the <em id="""">scid</em> mice demonstrate low levels of leakiness, or increasing levels of functional B and T cells over time. Interestingly, the severe combined immunodeficiency mutation results in NOD mice that are diabetes resistant. The NOD mouse strain is also the background strain for a higher-order immunodeficient mouse model, the NOD <em id="""">scid</em> gamma (NSG) strain, that will be introduced shortly.</p><p id="""">NOD-<em id="""">scid</em> mice are commonly used for patient-derived xenografts (PDXs), where human cancer xenografts (cells or tissue) from a patient’s tumor can be transplanted into PDX mice to characterize cancer growth and determine the effectiveness of various therapies. NOD-<em id="""">scid</em> mice can also be humanized by the introduction of adult human immune cells to study human immune responses. Naturally, PDXs require immunodeficient host strains to prevent rejection of xenografts. Several other mouse strains are also used for patient-derived xenografts, including <em id="""">scid</em>, Rag2-knockout, and athymic nude mice, which will also be discussed.</p><h4 id="""">NSG Mice</h4><p id="""">NSG is a brand name used for a strain of severely immunocompromised mice that are homozygous for both the <em id="""">Prkdc<sup id="""">scid</sup></em> allele and a null allele for the IL2 receptor common gamma chain (<em id="""">IL2rg<sup id="""">null</sup></em>) on the NOD background. The homozygous <em id="""">scid</em> mutation prevents the production of functional B and T cells in the mouse, and the homozygous <em id="""">IL2rg<sup id="""">null</sup></em> mutation compromises cytokine production, resulting in NK cell deficiency. These extremely immunodeficient mice can be used for engrafting human cells and tissues, including CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), patient-derived xenografts, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PMNC), and stem cells. This model is commonly used to study the human immune system, cancer, human immune cells, stem cells, diabetes, and human immune function.</p><h4 id="""">Nude Mice</h4><p id="""">Nude, or athymic, mice are another immunocompromised mouse strain that is used for human xenografts, which make them an excellent model for cancer research. This strain of mice was discovered in the 1960s and is almost completely hairless, hence the “nude” moniker. The strain is homozygous for a null <em id="""">Foxn1</em> mutation (<em id="""">Foxn1<sup id="""">nu</sup></em>), which prevents the formation of functional thymus epithelia and normal hair growth. The lack of thymus gland in these mice prevents the production of both antibodies (with the exception of IgM antibodies) and functional T cells. The lack of thymus is convenient for experiments that would otherwise require numerous thymectomy procedures. Nude mice are commonly used in dermatology and endocrine research, as well as studies characterizing T cell deficiencies and thymus disorders.</p><h3 id="""">Humanized Immune System Models</h3><p id="""">Immunocompromised mice engrafted with human cells or tissues is one way to study human disease. Another way of studying human disease is to genetically humanize the mouse. With this, genes from the human immune system are placed within the mouse which enables the evaluation of therapies relevant to human health in an <em id="""">in vivo</em> environment. As one example, mice with humanized immune genes have been used in COVID-19 studies in order to evaluate treatments and develop vaccines during the pandemic. When creating these models, human genes are often randomly inserted into the mouse genome.</p><h3 id="""">Gene Targeted Humanized Mice</h3><p id="""">Another way to humanize the mouse is to use a specific gene-targeted approach. In this way, the mouse genes are replaced to express human versions of those genes. This allows researchers to study human genes that contain gene mutations within a native and controlled genetic environment. Overall, researchers need to evaluate their field of research, what gene they’re studying, and which model type would be appropriate to them when they decide how to make humanized mice.</p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image "" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""""><div><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/665dc660af52559c0ed6ec8b/667b2acb44f58580d203e612_Downloadable-Icon-min.png"" alt="""" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto"" id=""""></div></figure><p id="""">Download Our <strong id="""">Free</strong> Humanization White Paper</p><p id=""""><a href=""https://go.genetargeting.com/humanization-white-paper"" target=""_blank"" id=""""><strong id="""">GET YOUR COPY</strong></a></p><h4 id="""">Humanized Mouse Models in COVID-19 Studies</h4><p id="""">Several transgenic humanized models carrying small-scale partially humanized gene expression units for human ACE2 receptors have been generated and studied. However, there are limitations to these partial humanized models and thus there is room for improvement for effectively studying SARS-CoV-2 infection. Of what is currently available, the clinical signs, recovery, and transmission vary between and within these models. Though there are humanized mice in use for COVID-19 research, there is a need for better humanized mice that are generated by replacing the genomic <a href=""https://genetargeting.com/mouse-models/ace2-transgenic-mice/"" id=""""><strong id="""">ACE2 mouse</strong></a> locus with the entire human ACE2 locus.

Scientists have proven time and time again that there are real, innovative achievements that we can look forward to with the help of knockout and knock-in mouse models. Their goal is to discover more efficient treatments for diseases like Alzheimer’s, cancer, diabetes, heart disease, as well as the numerous rare genetic diseases that continue to claim lives every year. It’s one that genetic engineering and manipulation can help us reach.</p><p id="""">Knockout mice are among the most favored and popular genetically modified animals that researchers tend to use. These mice have many potential benefits, some of which have proven to be quite effective. The science behind a knockout mouse model is simple: the mouse is designed to have one or more of its genes impaired and inactivated, so that researchers can better understand what happens in the body once the gene no longer fulfills its function. That way, many diseases and impairments can be studied while prototype treatments and drugs can be tested without any risks to human subjects. The use of humanized mice has helped this avenue of research along even more. Aside from the obvious similarities between the human and mouse genome, researchers are able to produce mice that are even more genetically similar to humans. This is accomplished by adding human genes to the mouse genetic makeup and then deactivating one of the vital genes to study the effects.</p><p id="""">While knockout mice can be extremely useful, they aren’t able to cover every level and variety of genetic manipulation that researchers need. For instance, even though early knockout mice were able to help researchers study the potential effects of the loss of a certain gene – since they were produced by disrupting the coding exons of a gene – these types of genetically modified mice did not have ability to help us learn about all the aspects of genetic mutation. For that purpose, knock-in mice were developed, allowing scientists to replace an original gene within the mouse’s genome with a new, foreign or mutated gene. Studying the effects of such mutations has proven to be invaluable throughout the past few years.Knock-in genes are produced primarily through the use of genetic vectors featuring flanking sequences known as loxP, which undergo reciprocal recombination when exposed to an enzyme known as Cre recombinase. Therefore, these types of knock-ins can allow for the immediate deletion and subsequent replacement of a piece of genetic coding with a sequence of the researchers’ choosing. As a result, many useful clinical applications are now possible that may not have happened solely with the use of knockout mice.</p><p id="""">While the concept of genetically modified mice has existed for years, scientists continue to come up with newer, more effective strategies for generating these models. Today, obtaining knockout or knock-in mice is quite simple, with knockout models available for purchase online and the use ES cells or CRISPR, which make the process straightforward. With the help of these genetic modification techniques, entire strains of genetically altered mice can be studied to examine the long-term effects of various mutations, genetic impairments and genetically caused ailments. The result is that medical researchers are better able to perfect drugs and genetic treatments to prevent side effects from impacting the next generation.</p>",

Whether it’s debilitating diseases like cancer or heart disease, or just mild allergies and other disorders than can impair daily life, genetic research aims to find better solutions and treatments. For that purpose, a variety of genetically modified animal models are used to unlock the secrets of the genome. Most of these are mice as their DNA is very similar to human DNA, making it easier to find similar or even identical genes to test. Knock-in and transgenic mice are just two of many types of genetically modified mice frequently used in research.</p><p id="""">First of all, it’s important to understand what knock-in and transgenic mice are and how they relate to each other. They are by no means identical, or even similar in many respects. While knock-in mice are designed to help scientists explore the possibilities of what might happen when a particularly targeted gene’s function is inactivated, genetic impairment in transgenic mice is more randomized. Because transgenic models use what is called “random integration,” researchers have very little control over where the desired gene actually ends up within the host genome. There is no mechanism in place to target a specific locus, which is what happens when knock-in mice are generating through the loxP and Cre recombinase method. Through the latter technique, it’s possible to precisely target the space that the newly introduced gene will occupy once the genetic mutation is complete.</p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image "" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""""><div id=""""><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/665dc660af52559c0ed6ec8b/667b2acb44f58580d203e612_Downloadable-Icon-min.png"" alt="""" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto"" id=""""></div></figure><p id=""""><strong id="""">Free Mouse Model Generation Guide:</strong> Step-by-step process for creating new custom models</p><p id=""""><a href=""https://genetargeting.com/mouse-model-generation-guide/"" target=""_blank"" id=""""><strong id="""">LEARN MORE</strong></a></p><p id="""">It’s important to note that both in transgenic and knock-in mouse models, the species from which the foreign genetic material comes from can differ from that of the original mouse.

Theories that can now be proven as true or false could not even have been explored before knock-in mice became prominent. Across the internet, it’s easy to find studies and news articles that mention how certain knock-in mouse models have helped researchers find better treatments and discover new mysteries related to the human genome without even having to use anything more than some basic genetic material.</p><p id="""">The field of genetics has evolved substantially since the first genetically modified animal was developed.

While knock-in mice are considered superior when it comes to their benefits and ability for accurate genetic targeting, transgenic mice can be equally valuable depending on the applications they are used for.

CRISPR/Cas9, a method that was previously believed to only work for generating knock-out mouse models, has been re-evaluated recently with some favorable results. Even though the success rate of most CRISPR knock-in protocols was below 10%, researchers are now realizing that the percentage could be higher by using a CRISPR protocol that was discovered through the testing of long, single-stranded DNAs serving as donors.</p><p id="""">A knock-in gene refers to a method of genetic engineering that involves the one-for-one substitution of a DNA sequence found at a specific locus, with another sequence. In some cases, the replacement sequence isn’t actually present within the locus, as it’s foreign to the organism. Gene knock-ins have been used and refined for a long time. Now, with the advent of genetic technology, it is possible to use increasingly more complicated, intricate and efficient knock-in methods, in order to achieve the desired result. Knock in mouse models have been used primarily for the purpose of creating disease models, allowing researchers to test how a certain gene or genetically induced disease behaves from birth to death, what medicines and drugs can be used for treatment, and what genetic mechanism fuels its progress.</p><p id="""">The most common technique for using gene knock-ins involves a slight change in the original knock-out protocol invented by Oliver Smithies, Martin Evans, and Mario Capecchi. Sometimes the modifications are introduced with the help of stem cells, while other times the mutated copy of a p53 gene will allow them to be inserted into the mouth genome. The recent improvements in knock-in gene creation due to CRISPR, however, have attracted the most recent spotlight. Although the efficiency is still not comparable to stem cells, the world of science is slowly recognizing the success of this CRISPR and aims to use it more in the near future. Regardless of the method used, a gene knock-in is regarded as a gain of function mutation, which means the body gains an added function aside from the ones that its DNA was already capable of. As a result, gene knock-ins in mice can be used to more accurately study genetic mutations in humans.</p><p id="""">Using CRISPR/Cas9 to obtain genetic mutations through knock-in mice is not a new concept. However, previously there were very few positive results, and most knock-in mice obtained with this technique died. With the use of long, single stranded DNA sources, however, it has been established that the CRISPR/Cas9 technique can be brought from a success rate of 1% to 10%, to higher than 10%. For obtaining knock-in mice, single-stranded donors have proven to be extremely efficient, both in the case of insertion and gene replacement. However, further research will be needed for considering the future success in generating knock-in mice. Most experts now believe it is a viable solution.</p><p id="""">‍</p>",

Unlike in gene knockout, where entire genes are erased, gene knockdown is a slightly different technique that only targets gene expressions. Through this experimental method, researchers are able to silence the expression of one or more genes in a single animal model, without eliminating the gene entirely. Knockdown mice are not yet engineered for commercial purposes, their primary design focusing on the academic research and scientific development of the technique. Only a few companies are currently able to offer commercial gene therapy options that use knockdown procedures.</p><h3 id="""">What Is a Knockdown Mouse and Why Is It Important?</h3><p id="""">If you are familiar with knockout mice, you already know that these mice are bred to have at least one particular gene completely erased from their genetic makeup. In contrast, a knockdown mouse is an animal model in which the gene expression of a certain, specific gene is only reduced by about 70%, and the gene is still very much intact in the genome. These mouse models are most typically used with the aim of managing serious physical conditions such as cancer, viruses and bacterial infections. RNAi has been used particularly for dealing with viruses, including HIV, as well as cancer. In both cases, the goal is to silence genes that feature expressions responsible for facilitating cancer growth and allowing viruses to replicate, respectively.</p><h3 id="""">RNA Interference – The Most Common Means of Obtaining Gene Knockdown</h3><p id="""">When you hear about the knockdown procedure that is most popular among researchers, RNA interference, or RNAi is the primary method most scientists will speak of. This procedure can be used in developing knockdown mice for research purposes through the use of mRNA degradation. Double-stranded interfering RNA (siRNA) is introduced into the cytoplasm of the ES cells, which leads to an often severe impairment of gene function within the developing mouse specimen. As the process is quick and inexpensive, it provides researchers with a unique and straightforward method for genetic functional analysis.</p><h3 id="""">Targeting Specific Mouse Genes with TALENs</h3><p id="""">This procedure uses effector nucleases known as TALENs to target genes more effectively. It is used for targeting specific genes more accurately, and it involves using sequence-specific effectors that can be introduced into a mouse cell as a plasmid. The ultimate goal is to cleave the target DNA sequence according to the sequence specified by the TALENs, and then use a process known as non-homologous end joining to repair the damage caused by the cleavage. Correcting the damage is important, since the cell’s repair attempts can lead to permanent damage and deletion errors, rendering the knockdown mice unusable.</p><h3 id="""">CRISPR, Gene Knockdown and Silencing</h3><p id="""">CRISPR is probably the easiest and fastest method of obtaining a viable knockdown mouse model. Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) is a relatively new technology which was first discovered with the help of prokaryotes. Proteins known as CRISPR-associated genes (or Cas genes) are utilized to insert small portions of exogenous DNA into a CRISPR repeat locus. In turn, these inserts are later used to introduce RNAs as template sequences that the Cas proteins use to partially or completely silence the targeted genes in the mouse genome. This elegant and accurate method for producing knockdown mice is commonly used by scientists as part of the most important and recent studies of the genetic development of various diseases.</p><p id="""">‍</p>",

We’re uncovering the underlying causes of conditions like cancer, diabetes, heart disease and many other debilitating disorders. Genetic research conducted on mice has helped advance our knowledge beyond anything scientists were able to achieve in the past.</p><h3 id="""">Understanding and Creating Knockout Mice for Research</h3><p id="""">Before examining the advantages of knockout mice, it’s important to understand their purpose and how they are created. The modern era of genetically modified mice began in the 1980s when researchers developed methods for changing the sequence of the mouse genome. Originally it was only possible to add new DNA sequences and there was a high degree of randomness causing unpredictable results. Soon people found ways to make more precise changes to the mouse genome, including changes that could disrupt the function of a single gene to create knockout mice. These mice can be normal and healthy in every way except for the changes to their DNA that inactivate one specific gene. The target gene in knockout mice is chosen depending on the purpose of the scientists’ research. For example, it may be known that a gene plays a role in preventing cancer, but the mechanism is unclear. Creating knockout mice with disruptions in that gene can unlock its function and even lead to development of new medicines.</p><h3 id="""">What Is the True Potential of Knockout Mouse Research?</h3><p id="""">Using knockout mice as models, researchers are able to tap into the link between the DNA’s blueprint and the sometimes unexplained diseases that have similar effects on humans and mice alike. The relatively short lifespans of mice means it’s possible to determine the effects of a gene knockout from birth right through old age. It’s also possible to observe the entire course of a disease such as cancer and test newly-developed medicines. While mice are not 100% perfect as test subjects used for studying human diseases, they hold great promise for future research goals. Thanks to animal models, research on genetics has advanced further than we ever anticipated.</p><p>‍</p>",

While human stem cells obtained from bone marrows, blood, placentas or even embryonic cells obtained from blastocysts left over after artificial insemination might be the most effective method of actually finding ways to cure diseases that affect humans, those cells aren’t as easy to come by or work with as animal stem cells. Animal stem cells – especially embryonic cells obtained from mice – offer scientists free reign in conducting just about any experiment they want, as opposed to the many limitations and ethical concerns associated with human ES cells.</p><h3 id="""">Why Are Animal Cell Lines So Important?</h3><p id="""">From genetically engineered mouse models to the use of stem cell lines obtained from mice, primates and various other animals, there is a tendency in the scientific world to test just about any new treatment method on animals, before resorting to human clinical studies. Animal cell lines are particularly important when it comes to evaluating the dangers that untested stem cell therapies could pose on eventual human test subjects. Another reason for using animal cell lines is genetic diversity and the ability to see how genetic research impacts different species or mutated members of the same species. Finally, animal cell lines, and mouse embryonic stem cells in particular, are easier to purchase, study and experiment with. In fact, there is an immeasurable amount of research material available on mouse cell lines that you can learn from – far more than the bodies of knowledge linked to any other area of stem cell research.</p><h3 id="""">The Benefits of Mouse Cell Lines</h3><p id="""">Mouse cell lineages are easy to work with, and can usually be obtained to facilitate specific types of experiments in areas where a large amount of starting material is needed, for example, in biochemistry. Also, as a beginning researcher, you can rely on readymade cell lines that are easier to maintain, grow and adapt than other varieties. Put simply, mouse cell lines can be some of the most practical assets in stem cell research, and their research potential is virtually limitless.</p><h3 id="""">Mouse Cells for Studying Genetic Mutation and Disease</h3><p id="""">Genetic mutations and the diseases they cause are among the main lines of study that most mouse models and mouse stem cell lines are selected for. Tumor cells can be strong research models, and they can show exactly how the various abnormalities that cause their excessive growth can be altered through drugs and stem cell treatments. APC and BRAF mutations are currently two of the most common types of mutations studied with the use of mouse cell lines. They are mainly utilized to study the development and possible treatment of colon, lung, esophageal, thyroid and skin cancers, as well as various birth defects commonly linked to these mutations.</p><h3 id="""">Commercially Available Mouse Cell Lines</h3><p id="""">Although thousands of human cell lines have also become available in recent years, mouse stem cell lines are still among the most readily found for specific purposes. Cells derived from mice may not be much cheaper than human cells in most cases, but regarding embryonic stem cells in particular, the availability rate and diversity of mouse stem cell lines is far greater than that of human-derived ES cells. As a result, when it comes to starting your stem cell research studies, mouse cells are probably your best option.</p><p>‍</p>",

Whether we’re talking about single or multiple point mutations, the protein function that is affected by these types of mutations can range from benign to severe. In some cases, it can also be beneficial. However, when diseases are present, studying the specific point mutations that can induce them might be essential to finding a cure for anything from certain types of cancer to rare diseases like Tay-Sachs.</p><h3 id="""">The Power and Diversification of Point Mutations</h3><p id="""">Point mutation diseases don’t always have to be the end result. In many instances, the consequences of a point mutation are neutral or even beneficial gene function. In fact, point mutations are responsible for the adaptation of certain organisms to adverse situations, that leads to evolution. Neutral mutations are also common when the change of one or more nucleotides doesn’t lead to a non-conservative missense mutation. This shows just how powerful point mutations truly are. That power is further increased when we learn that these mutations can also be used to induce certain diseases just by changing a single base pair. Researchers often use this action on purpose to study point mutations, point mutation diseases, and any potential therapies and treatments that can be effective against the generated conditions.</p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image "" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""""><div id=""""><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/665dc660af52559c0ed6ec8b/667b2acb44f58580d203e612_Downloadable-Icon-min.png"" alt="""" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto"" id=""""></div></figure><p id="""">Download Our <strong id="""">Free</strong> Point Mutation Comparison Chart</p><p id=""""><a href=""https://go.genetargeting.com/point-mutation-chart"" target=""_blank"" id=""""><strong id="""">GET YOUR COPY</strong></a></p><h3 id="""">Point Mutations and Immune System Problems</h3><p id="""">The study of diseases induced by point mutations take researchers frequently into the realm of the complexity of the human immune system. Primary immune system problems can be linked to specific gene defects that can be caused by point mutations. Scientists Troy Torgerson and Hans Ochs have studied the problem in great detail in 2014, and have come to the conclusion that enzyme replacement therapy can be an efficient way to counteract the problem, depending on the specific gene defect.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">RELATED:</strong> <a href=""https://genetargeting.com/point-mutation-mice/"" target=""_blank"" id="""">Point Mutation Mouse Models</a></p><h4 id="""">Tay-Sachs Disease</h4><p id="""">Tay-Sachs disease is one of those point mutation diseases that you don’t often hear about. However, it is very real, and the genetic defect that causes it is often passed down from parent to child. The defect is in the HEXA gene, on chromosome 15. This gene plays an important role in the function of the nervous system, and its impairment can lead to dangerously high levels of fatty tissue in the brain and spinal cord.</p><h4 id="""">Cancer and Tumors – The Main Diseases That Have to Be Studied</h4><p id="""">If the point mutation occurs in multiple tumor suppressors, the result is cancer. Now, the problem with cancer is that there are as many different types of it as there are potential genetic defects that can cause it. As a result, for example, a defect in the Adenomatous Polyposis Coli, caused by a point mutation, will lead to tumorigenesis. In the case of some types of cancer, such as prostate cancer, the effects are more unique. Prostate cancer has the lowest rate of point mutations compared to other forms of cancer, however, the frequency of point mutations measured in different samples of prostate cancer tumors tends to vary greatly. This goes to show that point mutation diseases are far more difficult to fully comprehend than we think, and a significant amount of research is still required.</p><p id="""">‍</p>",

Coronary heart disease alone kills more than 7 million people every year. Where available, proactive health care measures such as risk factor screening, behavior modification, and prophylactic drugs greatly reduce this burden. These advances in cardiovascular treatment were developed based on a tremendous volume of research in which animal models played a crucial role. In particular, rat models of heart disease have enabled tremendous advances in human health.</p><h3 id="""">Premiere animal model of human heart disease</h3><p id="""">Rats became the premiere animal model for human heart disease thanks in large part to new surgical techniques developed in the 1950s. Researchers needed animal models of different types of cardiovascular disease but this damage couldn’t be introduced in a reliable or reproducible manner. Because larger animals such as dogs were commonly used the cost of progress was unacceptably high. Both the ethical and monetary costs of using larger animals like dogs were proving unacceptably high. To identify the most tractable model of the human cardiovascular system researchers at the National Institutes of Health tested a procedure for damaging heart tissues in mice, rats, hamsters and guinea pigs. A simple surgical technique was found to work best in rat models and the method was widely adopted by the research community. This technique complemented a strain of hypertensive rats developed in Japan around the same time. Such models became the foundation of the modern era of research into the prevention and treatment of heart disease.</p><p id="""">In more recent years mice gained prominence as models for human heart disease because targeted genetic modifications could be introduced. Now the rat genome can be modified almost as freely as in the mouse with the new technique of gene editing in spermatagonial stem cells. This expansion of research possibilities should create a renaissance for the rat as a model for heart disease and the human cardiovascular system.</p><p id="""">If you need a custom rat model for your project, look no further than <strong id="""">ingenious</strong>.

This method can be used with a minimum amount of specialized training and equipment. A plasmid containing DNA to be knocked in can be created using the same process most labs use every day. Injecting DNA into mouse embryos requires practice and is a standard skill for technicians in core facilities. However, the ease of creating such mouse models using random DNA insertion is balanced by unpredictable results. It was quickly realized that a more consistent strategy was needed and the discovery of the Rosa26 locus enabled a new and more consistent method for generating knock-in mice. </p><h2 id=""""><strong id="""">What is the Rosa26 Gene in Mice?</strong></h2><p id="""">Rosa26 refers to a specific site on the mouse chromosome 6. It was identified in a screen that was designed to find places in the genome where the insertion of foreign DNA would not have unpredictable results. Unpredictable results in this case could mean two things – either unwanted effects on the health of the mouse or unpredictable expression of the foreign DNA. Carefully targeting the foreign DNA into the Rosa26 locus seems to have essentially no effect on the mouse’s health. In addition, the DNA that’s inserted will have a consistent expression pattern. With the older method of randomly inserting DNA into the genome, it’s possible for the new DNA to have an unpredictable expression pattern. This can happen if it’s inserted near another gene, and that gene’s promoter influences the inserted DNA. With the Rosa26 locus this is not the case. </p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image "" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""""><div id=""""><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/665dc660af52559c0ed6ec8b/667b2acb44f58580d203e612_Downloadable-Icon-min.png"" alt="""" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto"" id=""""></div></figure><p id="""">Download Our <strong id="""">Free</strong> Quick Guide: Rosa26 Knockin Approaches &amp; Targeted Transgenics</p><p id=""""><a href=""https://go.genetargeting.com/rapid-rosa26-quick-guide"" target=""_blank"" id=""""><strong id="""">GET YOUR COPY</strong></a></p><h2 id=""""><strong id="""">Why is the Rosa26 Gene Used?</strong></h2><p id="""">Rosa26 is used for knockin mice when consistent results are the most important criteria. A Rosa26 knockin mouse will have a single copy of the foreign DNA inserted into a known site in the genome. The DNA will be expressed in a consistent way and that won’t change from generation to generation as the mice are bred. In contrast, with the random insertion method multiple copies of the DNA will be inserted. Many more mice will need to be bred and tested until the new line has a stable expression pattern, and that pattern may not be exactly what was intended. Targeting to the Rosa26 locus is the clear choice for consistent results. </p><p id="""">The long track record of success using the Rosa26 locus, and the consistent results that it can obtain, are balanced by a more complex process for creating models. A targeted transgenic knockin requires additional steps to create as well as more technical knowledge. The standard method is to create a genetic targeting construct which will be larger than the plasmids most labs are used to working with. Embryonic stem cells must be cultured, modified, and screened. Correctly modified cells are then injected into mouse embryos to make chimeras. Partnering with an experienced team streamlines all these steps and can prove invaluable when taking advantage of the consistent, reliable results that Rosa26 knockins can provide.</p><p id=""""><a href=""https://go.genetargeting.com/subscribe-to-ingenious?_ga=2.27283196.172984620.1689620143-1619993392.1680271047"" target=""_blank"" id=""""><strong id="""">SUBSCRIBE TO OUR NEWSLETTER</strong></a></p><p id="""">‍</p>",

While species such as <em id="""">saccharomyces cerevisiae</em>, fruit flies, and zebrafish have been used for the study of cancer, organ development, recombination or large scale mutations, the rat model offers insights into human disease that the study of other species will not allow. When animals such as mice or rats are selected as models for genetic experimentation, the main reason is the similarity of their genetic makeup to human DNA. In the case of rats specifically, their particular DNA and physiology has allowed scientists to explore a variety of physiological and pathophysiological mechanisms that would not be possible in a mouse model.</p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image "" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""""><div id=""""><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/665dc660af52559c0ed6ec8b/667b298be9b35a539022b921_shutterstock_564425215-small-1024x658.jpeg"" alt=""advantages of rat models"" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto"" id=""""></div></figure><h3 id="""">The Rat as a Model System</h3><p id="""">Rats were the first mammalian species specifically domesticated to be used in the laboratory. Two centuries ago, the brown rat <em id="""">Rattus norvegicus</em> was used by scientists to understand human physiology and medicine, concentrating on the effects of food and oxygen deprivation. Rats have since been used to answer a wide range of basic science questions related to common human diseases in the fields of physiology, immunology, pharmacology, toxicology, nutrition, behavior and learning.</p><h3 id="""">What are the advantages of using rats in human disease research?</h3><p id="""">Rats are an ideal choice for many labs due to their physiological similarity to humans. Also, since rats are easier to feed and smaller in size than other complex mammals, such as primates, they are a more convenient option for many researchers.</p><p id="""">With the sequencing of the Brown Norway rat in 2004 by the Rat Genome Sequencing Project Consortium, led by the Baylor College of Medicine, it is now known that almost all disease-linked human genes have counterparts in the rat. Also, after advances in gene targeting and gene editing, it is possible to specifically modify the rat genome to produce knockouts and knockins, further enhancing our understanding of human disease through the development of powerful customized CRISPR rat models. Gene editing technologies allow scientists to use rats more often in their research. Better rat models are likely to decrease drug failure in clinical trials – currently standing at about 90% – which will decrease development costs and time to market. The sequenced genome will also unveil new targets for drug intervention.</p><h3 id="""">What are the disadvantages of not using a rat model for certain types of studies?</h3><p id="""">In terms of the diseases that they are used to study, rats are usually not the model of choice when it comes to disorders related to neoplasms, blood and immune function. However, they’re more widely used in studying cardiovascular and metabolic disorders, as well as the onset of conditions that relate to the brain, digestive system, and various health problems related to behavior. Researchers are often advised to begin their studies using rat models in these areas, not only because they are a suitable model, but also due to the fact that rats have already helped scientists reach a few significant breakthroughs in these areas. Some of the disadvantages of choosing a different animal model for these fields could be difficulty in collecting accurate data, comparing data from previous studies that used rat models, and drawing definitive conclusions that could apply to future studies.</p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image "" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""""><a href=""https://go.genetargeting.com/rat-model-technology-guide"" target=""_blank"" id=""""><div id=""""><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/665dc660af52559c0ed6ec8b/667b298b866d65b51ebcebaa_Rat-Model-Guide-CTA.jpeg"" alt=""Free Rat Model Guide"" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto"" id=""""></div></a></figure><h4 id="""">Researchers choose rats over other species for a number of reasons:</h4><ul id=""""><li id="""">The larger size when compared to mice makes handling, sampling and performing procedures easier.</li><li id="""">From a physiological standpoint, more is known about the responses and pathways in rats than in other species due to the wealth of data collected over the years.<ul id=""""><li id="""">Some results suggest that the rat more accurately reflects human physiology than other species, mimicking human disease more accurately in many cases.</li></ul></li><li id="""">Behavioural research shows rats are more suited to studies on learning and cognition because they are more capable of learning tasks than other species.<ul id=""""><li id="""">The rat’s ability to learn, remember, and interact gives them an advantage over other species, allowing for insights into the basic principles behind learning and behavior which can then be translated to human behavior and learning.</li></ul></li><li id="""">It is now possible to more easily manipulate the rat genome to produce specific gene knockouts and knockins and apply results to our understanding of human genetic disorders.</li></ul><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image "" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""""><div id=""""><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/665dc660af52559c0ed6ec8b/667b298bed5f5a9d26d8bb1e_Add-a-heading-1024x307.png"" alt=""rat model advantages"" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto"" id=""""></div></figure><h3 id="""">The power of rodent models</h3><p id="""">The rat had historically been the preferred animal model for biomedical research due to genetic and physiological similarities to humans. In 2001 however with the development of targeted genetic manipulation in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells, rats took somewhat of a back seat as the rodent of choice for specific gene targeting because this technology was not yet available in the rat. As a result, mice became the more prominent model organism due to the availability of genetically modified lines where a gene of interest can be activated or inactivated in specific cells.</p><p id="""">In mice, ES cells can be maintained in their pluripotent state easily. The same methods that allow this to be so in mice have failed in rats. Rat ES cells are very unstable, with any disturbance leading them to activate, so that they could not be implanted in an embryo and brought to term. The power of mouse models proved to be so clear however that the same abilities in rat continued to be desired and pursued.</p><p id="""">Now, researchers no longer have to choose between the anatomical advantages of rats and the genetic tractability of mice, due to new methods for introducing genetic modifications into the rat genome. Significant progress was made in 2008 by Professor Austin Smith’s lab at Cambridge, and Professor Qi-Long Ying’s lab at the University of Southern California with the first targeting of rat ES cells achieved. Although the ability to target rat ES cells was then available, doing so was still difficult. It was around this time that gene editing came into being, specifically Zn Finger nucleases and TALENS. Although expensive to produce and not always precise, this became the preferred method to target rats in a specific manner.</p><p id="""">Then in 2012, CRISPR/Cas9 changed genome manipulation as we know it. With a much less expensive and more precise method for targeting genomes via embryos, the potential for rats as a model system of human disease could be pursued even easier. And more precise technologies have become available as well, such as using CRISPR to targeting rat spermatogonial stem cells. This alleviates the mosaicism common with targeting embryos, allowing for the production of <a href=""https://genetargeting.com/crispr-rat-models/"" id=""""><strong id="""">specifically targeted germline rats</strong></a> in as little as 3 months.

The term “cerebral palsy” denotes a highly variable syndrome affecting up to 3 out of every 1000 children born. It’s characterized primarily by motor impairment, but there are also a range of accompanying conditions such as seizure disorders and cognitive defects. In the process of finding a cure, the development of medicines to treat cerebral palsy is hampered by incomplete understanding of the condition’s earliest stages, when the brain first responds to an injury. Rodent models of cerebral palsy have been studied for almost forty years to fill the gaps in our knowledge, hopefully pointing the way to future treatments.</p><p id=""""><em id="""">“ingenious was very competitively priced compared to other reputable transgenic companies.

The hypoxia-ischemia model, first published in 1981, has brain damage similar to that observed in cerebral palsy patients. Originally the method was used on rat pups seven days after birth, when their brains are most similar to those of newborn babies. It has since been applied to a variety of species, to leverage similarities between the brains of humans and different animals. In recent years mice have been used with increasing frequency, to take advantage of genetically modified lines as well as the relatively lower costs compared with rats. However mice are less likely to survive the hypoxia-ischemia procedure, display a wider variety of brain damage, and have dramatic strain-to-strain differences. Rat models are therefore still widely used.

Poorly designed studies result in unreproducible results that contribute to both delays and costs of therapeutic drug development. With growing pressure and scrutiny on preclinical biomedical research[^2], strategic planning and addressing pitfalls that can be overlooked, especially before the research plan starts, is not only crucial for obtaining reliable and reproducible results but it could determine whether a research award or investment gets granted[^3]. Here’s a look at some of the most frequent issues researchers face and how to overcome them:</p><p id="""">‍</p><h2 id=""""><strong id="""">1: Improper Selection of the Appropriate Model</strong></h2><p id="""">The foundation of any successful research study lies in choosing a suitable mouse model. A critical mistake researchers make is using inappropriate or obsolete tools that do not align with their study’s objectives [^4]. For example, a particular mouse model might be known not to reproduce human disease to provide meaningful information sufficiently, resulting in findings that do not apply to human conditions. Researchers usually perceive that not using the most advanced models will save time and money despite the known limitations in translating findings to human conditions. One significant factor is the historical data and extensive research foundation already established with a particular model, making them a convenient baseline for comparison and experiment continuity. Notable examples include models of chronic inflammatory diseases, where early mouse models, while initially providing mechanistic insights, failed to replicate the human disease, particularly regarding chronicity and gene responses[^5]. Since then, enhanced humanized immune system mouse models have been developed to understand human immunology better and develop immunotherapies[^6], [^7]. </p><p id="""">The recent advancement of genome editing tools, including CRISPR/Cas9, has significantly accelerated the generation of certain custom mouse models for research with extreme precision, ie \- conventional knockouts and point mutation knock-in models. CRISPR technologies can allow the routine humanization of individual codons. By creating strains with human clinical variants (∼50% of which are point mutations), these genetically engineered humanized mouse models offer significant research advantages: they can represent human diseases, providing insights into pathophysiology and treatment responses, while the time and cost of model generation have decreased[^8]. Custom humanized models enable the study of human-specific pathogens, immune responses, and disease mechanisms, leading to more effective therapies and drugs \- consequently reducing clinical trial failures and accelerating new treatment development[^9].</p><p id="""">‍</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Tips:</strong></h3><ul id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Utilize Catalogs:</strong> Research available models thoroughly to determine if they are adequate for your specific study aims. A well-crafted catalog must provide extensive strain datasheets, including how each was created and updated information on their usage.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Detailed Planning and Expert Consultation:</strong> Seek advice from experts to ensure that a model aligns with your research goals, such as collaborating with a laboratory with an established track record on mouse model research on your specific field or disease of interest or a shared resource/core facility. Biotechnology companies specializing in genetically modified mouse models for scientific research are also invaluable sources of expertise in current mouse models and genetic engineering and have a broad and up-to-date awareness of the latest trends in the industry and preclinical research.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Consider tailored humanized models</strong> designed to meet your study’s unique requirements. Custom animal model creation services offer improved gene editing techniques, including enhanced CRISPR technologies, enabling the more precise and efficient creation of relevant humanized mouse models. </li></ul><p id="""">Specialized biotechnology companies and CROs with state-of-the-art expertise in genetic engineering and comprehensive services can help speed up your research while supporting consistent and relevant outcomes.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h2 id=""""><strong id="""">2: Inadequate Genetic Background and Variability</strong></h2><p id="""">Genetic variability among mouse strains can significantly influence research outcomes. Different mouse strains carry various genetic variants that might impact research results. If not adequately controlled, experimental or control groups in mouse studies can have a biased representation of these variants, affecting the phenotype as much as the experimental variable being studied[^10]. Ignoring these differences can lead to inconsistent and non-reproducible results.</p><p id="""">One dramatic example of how genetic background can mislead research results is the overexpression of the Alzheimer’s amyloid precursor protein (Tg(APP695) transgene). This results in significantly different phenotypes depending on the mouse strain, from merely producing amyloid plaques in outbred strains to a lethal phenotype in FVB/N or C57BL/6J mice[^11]. Using mice with inadequate or unrepresentative genetic backgrounds can compromise the study's validity.</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Tips:</strong></h3><ul id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Source your animals from a trusted vendor</strong> that carefully controls the genetics of inbred strains by refreshing from cryopreserved stock and performing extensive genetic testing.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Research genetic backgrounds:</strong> pay close attention to the genetic composition of your models to avoid unexpected variability that can affect your results.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Carefully plan cohort development and colony maintenance</strong> to prevent genetic drift and genetic contamination with substrains. Again, consultation with experts is critical to avoid costly mistakes.&nbsp;</li></ul><p id="""">‍</p><h2 id=""""><strong id="""">3: Uncontrolled Environmental Factors</strong></h2><p id="""">Environmental conditions play a crucial role in the behavior and physiology of mouse models. Housing, diet, and handling can introduce significant variability if not adequately controlled. Preclinical mouse models show that housing temperature significantly affects the gut microbiome, with cooler temperatures (22°-23 °C) inducing chronic adrenergic stress and altering microbial composition, particularly enriching Lachnospiraceae. This modulation impacts experimental outcomes, including tumor growth, highlighting the importance of considering housing temperature in experimental reproducibility[^12]. Overlooking these factors can lead to biased and irreproducible outcomes, undermining the reliability of the research.</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Tips:</strong></h3><ul id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Standardize Conditions:</strong> Regularly monitor and standardize the microbiome, diet, and handling practices to ensure uniformity across experiments.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Outsource to Expert Housing Services:</strong> Utilize facilities with consistent and controlled environmental conditions to minimize variability.</li></ul><p id="""">‍</p><h2 id=""""><strong id="""">4: Flawed Experimental Design and Statistical Analysis</strong></h2><p id="""">The reliability of experimental findings depends on the rigor of experimental design. A robust experimental design and proper statistical analysis are essential for generating valid and reliable research findings. Unfortunately, many academic studies fail to sufficiently detail key measures essential in in-vivo research, making it challenging to detect biases and misinterpretations[^13]. Pitfalls that hinder the quality of in vivo research are:</p><ul id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Not stating Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria</strong>: Pre-determining and reporting rules for including or excluding subjects and data are vital in maintaining transparency and consistency.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Lack of Randomization</strong>: Assigning subjects randomly to different groups to assure that each group is statistically comparable.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Poor Blinding</strong>: To prevent bias in interpretation, the researchers assessing the outcomes must be unaware of which group each subject belongs to.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Inadequate Sample Size</strong>: Calculating the number of subjects needed to detect a meaningful effect ensures that the study is adequately powered.</li></ul><p id="""">All of this can introduce bias and affect the integrity of the results. Notably, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) mandate to consider sex as a biological variable to be controlled in preclinical research discourages bias toward using a specific sex[^14].</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Tips:</strong></h3><ul id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Implement Rigorous Planning:</strong> Ensure adequate sample sizes, randomization, and blinding are in place to produce credible and reproducible outcomes.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Always Consult with Biostatisticians:</strong> Work with biostatisticians to design robust experiments that minimize bias and maximize the validity of the results.</li></ul><p id="""">‍</p><h2 id="""">‍<strong id="""">5: Poor Reporting Standards</strong></h2><p id="""">A 2015 report estimated that the prevalence of irreproducible preclinical research exceeded 50%, resulting in approximately $28 billion annually spent on irreproducible research in the United States alone[^15]. &nbsp;While controlling the technical misalignments described above is necessary to ensure reproducibility, most studies would still be flawed if the reported research does not reflect the actual research. Poor reporting practices are a major contributor to irreproducible research[^16], jeopardizing the credibility of the main findings from animal research[^17]. &nbsp;In 2019, it was broadly estimated that US biomedical and agricultural R\&amp;D waste due to flawed preclinical animal research ranged from $5 billion to $9 billion in taxpayer-funded studies and $9 billion to $15 billion in industry resources per year[^18]. Transparent reporting is a fundamental principle of scientific research. Incomplete reporting and a lack of transparency can severely diminish a study’s impact or invalidate completely its conclusions. Improving the conduct and reporting of in vivo research is a priority for many funders and publishers.</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Tips:</strong></h3><ul id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">If budget allows, outsource to a reputable contract research organization or preclinical services. </strong>To ensure the integrity of your research, consider companies with a proven record of prioritizing reproducibility and comprehensive reporting.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Adhere to Established Guidelines: </strong>Follow established guidelines for reporting research to enhance transparency and reproducibility, such as ARRIVE 2\.0[^19], even if your funding agency does not enforce them.</li></ul><p id="""">‍</p><h2 id=""""><strong id="""">Conclusion</strong></h2><p id="""">In summary, addressing common pitfalls is crucial for improving the reliability and impact of mouse model research. Researchers can achieve more consistent and translatable outcomes by collaborating with experts, which helps select the appropriate model, carefully consider genetic variability, control environmental factors, design robust experiments, and adhere to strict reporting standards. &nbsp;<br>Biomedical research institutions that maintain core facilities and shared resource units for mouse model research can improve the quality of their animal model research by implementing standard operating procedures (SOPs) and transparency protocols, which are strict requirements in industry suppliers of mouse models[^20].</p><p id="""">‍</p><h2 id=""""><strong id="""">About Ingenious Targeting Laboratory, Inc.</strong></h2><p id="""">Since 1998, ingenious targeting laboratory has been a leading provider of custom genetically modified mouse models.

An Introduction to Transgenic Mice and Their Role in Genetic Research</h2><p id="""">What are transgenic mice? The short answer is that they’re mice that have been artificially modified at a genetic level to include a foreign sequence, or transgene. This often involves the insertion of a human gene into the mouse’s genome to create a humanized mouse. Methods for creating transgenic mice are versatile, making it possible to create transgenic mice for many different kinds of research. In translational cancer research, transgenic mice are a powerful tool in assessing the potential validity of targeted therapy because the targets can be precisely inactivated in the setting of a developing or developed tumor.</p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image "" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""""><div><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/665dc660af52559c0ed6ec8b/667b95cef5013932466af58f_Transgenic-Mice.jpeg"" alt=""Transgenic Mice"" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto"" id=""""></div></figure><h2 id="""">Why are Transgenic Mice Important?</h2><p id="""">In order to understand transgenic mice, it is first necessary to learn about transgenes. <strong id="""">Transgenes are genes that have been taken from one organism and transferred to the genetic makeup of another.</strong> For example, a human gene can be copied and transferred to the genetic makeup of a mouse in order to study human disease in a model biological system.</p><p id="""">The most common methods of introducing a transgene into an animal model involve genetic manipulation, such as by pronuclear injection of embryos or by homologous recombination in cells.

This trend changed however in the 1970’s with the work of Beatrice Mintz Rudolf Jaenisch: the production of the first transgenic mouse. It was generated by inserting a DNA virus into an early-stage mouse embryo and showing that the inserted genes were present in every cell. Though the transgenic mice did not pass the transgene to their offspring, this began a cascade of experiments by researchers around the world refining methods of germline modification and using these techniques to elucidate the activity and function of genes in a way that was never possible before.</p><h3 id="""">How are Transgenic Mice Made?</h3><p id="""">Two basic approaches exist for creating transgenic mice. The first involves delivery of the transgene into a single cell of the mouse embryo via pronuclear injection. Through this method, researchers can overexpress new genes, effectively creating a transgenic mouse. The second method is through the modification of embryonic stem cells via homologous recombination, and the injection of the targeted ES cells into mouse blastocysts.</p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image "" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""""><div><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/665dc660af52559c0ed6ec8b/667b95ce7b448c32b81ac39e_Transgenic-Mice-Generating-3-Approaches-min.jpeg"" alt=""Generating Transgenic Mice: 3 Approaches"" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto"" id=""""></div></figure><h2 id="""">Transgenic Mice Technologies</h2><h3 id="""">Knockin Permissive or Safe Harbor Locus Model</h3><p id="""">Using homologous recombination, a more predictable and stable gain-of-function model can be obtained.

This model has been shown that <em id="""">Npm1</em> mutations affect megakaryocytic development and mimics some features of human <em id="""">NPM1</em>-mutated AML, thus serving as a good model for further investigations of AML.</p><h4 id="""">Transgenic Mice using the CRISPR/Cas9 System</h4><p id="""">In recent years, scientists have been trying to improve the technologies for obtaining transgenic mice. One more recent development is that of CRISPR/Cas9 technology, which can be used to accurately target gene edits in mouse embryos without the need for targeting ES cells first. This system consists of a Cas9 nuclease, which can be directed to any genomic locus by an appropriate single guide RNA (sgRNA).</p><p id="""">In addition, the simultaneous injection of Cas9 mRNA and sgRNA into the cytoplasm of zygotes has been shown to efficiently and reliably generate knockout mice with the highest targeting efficiency of all engineered nucleases. Therefore, CRISPR/Cas9 represents an efficient method for generating transgenic mice due to its simplicity, cost-effectiveness, high efficiency, and low fetal toxicity even at relatively high doses of Cas9 mRNA and sgRNA.</p><h3 id="""">Knockin Mice vs. Transgenic Mice</h3><p id="""">The different methods for making mouse lines can be confusing when trying to understand “what are transgenic mice made for.” Generally, transgenic mice are created through random insertion of a gene, while knockin mice involve introducing the gene at a specific locus within the mouse genome. Creating mouse models with the knockin strategy is more complex but removes the unpredictable element that comes with random transgenic insertion. Carefully evaluating the options along with your research plans is crucial to the long-term success of your lab’s research.</p><p id=""""><em id="""">“I’ve been working with iTL over the past 5 years in the production of 3 different genetically altered mice.

Many animal species can be used to create transgenic models, including fruit flies and zebrafish, but the biology of non-mammals is often significantly different from human biology.

Even though rats have been used for common research purposes such as testing drugs and genetically modified organic substances to help treat certain diseases, scientists were unable to develop knockout or knockin transgenic rats until about 10 years ago. The technology was successful but not consistent, after researchers figured out how to correctly harvest and maintain rat ES cells, which is much more complicated in comparison to mouse ES cells. These methods, combined with advanced genetic modification technologies such as CRISPR/Cas9, paved the way for genetic scientists to explore and decode physiological processes relating to metabolic, cardiovascular and brain functions that were still impossible to target using transgenic mouse models.</p><p id="""">Since the first genetic technologies for developing transgenic rats vs mice were created more than three decades ago, scientists had time to perfect them and come up with new and improved methods to make the process more accurate and prevent problems such as embryonic lethality. Some of the most significant breakthroughs for generating transgenic rats and mice were TALEN and ZFN technologies, along with the aforementioned CRISPR. Transposon-mediated mutagenesis and other methods for the modification of rat ES cells followed as well, allowing genetic researchers to target knockin and knockout genes more effectively. These processes also allowed them to improve the accuracy of experiments, and ensure that the manipulation of mouse and rat genomes could be performed through minimally invasive procedures, with less time needed.</p><p id="""">The issue of transgenic rats vs mice is predicted to become more significant in the near future. Rat models are expected to become the preferred models for highly targeted genetic research goals for certain disease areas that would be impossible to pursue using mouse DNA. However, they come with challenges such as finding space, establishing suitable animal facilities, and covering other potential costs, which will likely lead many scientists to continue working with transgenic mice for the foreseeable future. Fortunately, many researchers and companies dealing with the commercial aspect of genetic engineering are viewing mouse and rat models as equally important, in order to facilitate studies that would be better suited to one or the other. The discussion of transgenic rats vs mice is, therefore, expected to be an ongoing one, as researchers continue to find more complex and intricate means of enhancing both lines of research.</p><p>‍</p>",

Today it’s straightforward to look up almost any gene and find a wealth of sequencing information, including patient data if the gene is implicated in disease. &nbsp;Frequently there will be mutant sequences identified in the gene of interest that may or may not be relevant to other projects. When multiple mutations such as point mutations are known, they must all be evaluated to determine which ones should be prioritized for further study. </p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">What are the types of point mutations?</strong></h3><p id="""">Point mutations alter a single nucleotide in the genetic code. The effects of such a change can range from completely disrupting the gene’s function to causing essentially no functional change at all. Most genes encode a protein sequence and the function of the gene is to produce the correct amount of properly-made protein. Point mutations can affect the amount of protein that is made or the ability of that protein to function properly. Thus the different types of point mutations are referred to by their effects on protein function and expression level. </p><p id="""">At one end of the spectrum of possible effects are silent and conservative mutations. These cause no change in the function of the protein encoded by the gene, or a change that’s so minor it’s hard to measure. Silent mutations are possible because of the way genetic code is translated into protein sequence. The genetic code has redundancy built in, so sometimes changes to genes don’t result in changes to the final protein. Conservative mutations occur when the protein sequence is changed but the new amino acid is similar to the original one. </p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image "" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""""><div id=""""><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/665dc660af52559c0ed6ec8b/667b2acb44f58580d203e612_Downloadable-Icon-min.png"" alt="""" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto"" id=""""></div></figure><p id="""">Download Our <strong id="""">Free</strong> Point Mutation Comparison Chart</p><p id=""""><a href=""https://go.genetargeting.com/point-mutation-chart"" target=""_blank"" id=""""><strong id="""">GET YOUR COPY</strong></a></p><p id="""">Non-conservative mutations can be more severe because they cause a greater change to the protein sequence or expression level. An example would be changing an acidic amino acid into a basic one. However, this kind of mutation can also be mild if the protein sequence is changed in a domain that’s not crucial. Evaluating this kind of mutation requires extensive knowledge about the protein and which parts of the sequence and structure are vital. </p><p id="""">Then there are the point mutations with the greatest effect which alter the code that marks the start or stop of the gene’s coding sequence. Mutations of this type may occur in the existing “start” or “stop” codons of the gene’s sequence or they can happen somewhere else and create a new “start” or “stop” codon in the wrong place. A final type of point mutation affects a non-coding region of a gene. These can affect the gene in unpredictable ways, for example if the mutation is in the promoter region that controls the gene’s activity. Such a mutation could alter the level of protein that is made from the gene but not change the protein sequence. This varied list of different effects from point mutations highlights why it’s so important to evaluate them carefully, especially if considering them for use in experiments. </p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Why It’s Important to Understand Types of Mutations</strong></h3><p id="""">The different effects from point mutations listed above are only an introduction to the complex ways that a single nucleotide change can alter a gene’s function. There are even more layers of complexity when looking at the effects of a mutation in the context of an animal or person because a gene may have different functions in different tissues or at different stages of life. However, a basic understanding of the different types of point mutation can provide guidance when looking at a list of different mutations and deciding which ones are most likely to be interesting for your specific research project.</p><h3 id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">Want more information for your next research project?</em></strong></h3><h3 id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">Get in touch with us!</em></strong></h3><p id=""""><a href=""https://genetargeting.com/quote-request-form/"" target=""_blank""><strong id="""">GET A QUOTE</strong></a></p>",

When choosing a mouse model in particular, one option that should be thoroughly evaluated is a conditional allele. <strong id="""">What is a conditional allele and why is so important for research?</strong> Read on to learn how a conditional allele can provide more accurate control over genetic modifications.</p><h3 id="""">Definition of an Allele</h3><p id="""">What is a conditional allele, and what is it used for? <strong id="""">In simple terms, an allele is a variant form of a gene.</strong> The word allele could refer to the different gene sequences that exist naturally in a population, or in an animal model, it could be a change that was deliberately introduced. Normally a gene’s sequence is the same in essentially every cell of the body.</p><p id="""">In the early days of genetically modified mice, this was also true of genetic changes introduced by researchers. Mice in particular continue to be invaluable, as a large number of different mouse models are now already available. This is thanks to genetic modification techniques that have been developed over the past few decades.</p><p id="""">However certain research questions require an animal model where a gene has a different allele in different cells. For example it could be necessary for most cells to have a functional copy of a gene while just a few cells contain a non-functioning copy. Conditional alleles therefore are designed to enable control over exactly when and where different alleles will be expressed in an animal model. Conditional alleles in genetically modified mice allow for the deletion of a gene of interest in a target tissue when combined with a tissue-specific Cre recombinase. A conditional allele is achieved by introducing LoxP sites around a critical exon, a gene, or a cluster of genes.</p><h3 id="""">Comparing a Knockout Allele and a Conditional Knockout Allele</h3><p id="""">In the context of genetically modified animals, the simplest way to answer “what is a conditional allele?” is to directly compare two types of mouse models: knockouts and conditional knockouts. Knockout mice are a type of mouse model where a specific gene has been altered to permanently disrupt its function. This disruption, or knockout, affects the gene in every single cell of the mouse’s body and at all stages of its life. A common way to knock out a gene would be to delete part of its sequence – this is a permanent change that can’t be reversed. These types of animal models have been valuable for many studies but their limitations can get in the way of some experiments.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">A conditional knockout allele can achieve the same result, which is the disruption of the gene’s function, but with more control.</strong> This is because the conditional knockout allele will initially function just like the natural unmodified gene. Part of the gene can be deleted just like the knockout allele but the deletion has to be triggered by researchers. This principle applies to all conditional alleles: they initially express one sequence, then can be switched to expressing a different sequence. The switch from normal sequence to disrupted knockout sequence is just one example of a conditional allele.</p><h3 id="""">Generating a Conditional Allele in Mice</h3><p id="""">Precise and specific genetic modifications must be made in order to create conditional alleles and the process is too complex to briefly describe. To focus on the important details, a specific DNA sequence called loxP is the crucial element of what a conditional allele is. For example, a conditional knockout allele requires the placement of two copies of the loxP sequence in a target gene. Other conditional allele designs use the loxP sequence in different ways. There are constant improvements being made to the methods used to create conditional alleles in mice. It’s possible that new developments, such as the CRISPR/Cas9 method, may make it easier to create conditional alleles in the future.</p><h3 id="""">Types of mouse models with conditional alleles:</h3><ul id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Retain wild-type expression</strong> and are amenable to conditional, tissue-specific and/or time-dependent deletion. This approach is particularly necessary for manipulating the approximately 30% of genes that affect the viability of homozygous mutants when deleted. For example, embryonic lethality caused by the deletion of the coding regions of <em id="""">Mixl1 (Pulina et al., 2014)</em> or <em id="""">Brca1 (Xu et al., 1999)</em> can be rescued by conditional mutagenesis. This generates models that can be used to investigate specific gene-dependent processes during mammalian embryogenesis, neurodevelopment and breast cancer when combined with an appropriate <em id="""">Cre</em>-expressing line that enables tissue- or developmental-stage-specific gene deletion.</li></ul><ul id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">“Knockout-first”</strong> uses a variation of gene targeting to create a highly versatile allele that combines both gene trap and conditional gene targeting to generate a reporter-tagged knockout allele. The “knockout-first” allele is generated by inserting an FRT-flanked gene-trap vector, which contains a splice-acceptor sequence upstream of a lacZ reporter gene and a strong polyadenylation stop sequence, into an upstream intron. This creates an in-frame fusion transcript that will disrupt the expression of the targeted allele. Additionally, an adjacent exon coding sequence is flanked with loxP sites. This allele can then be converted into a null allele by Cre to abrogate gene expression or into a conditional allele by Flp, which can subsequently be converted by Cre into a null allele. The knockout-first strategy is versatile because it uses a single targeting vector to monitor gene expression using a reporter and tissue-specific gene function using Cre, thereby avoiding embryonic lethality. Models using this knockout-first strategy, include models of skin abnormalities (Liakath-Ali et al, 2014) and age-related hearing loss (Kane et al., 2012).</li></ul><ul id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Conditionals by inversion</strong> employ an inverted module that contains a reporter gene (e.g. <em id="""">GFP</em>) flanked by mutant recombinase target sites (<em id="""">lox66</em> and <em id="""">lox71</em>) positioned in a head-to-head orientation to enable inversion by Cre recombinase inserted into the anti-sense strand of a target gene. Cre “flips” the inverted module into the sense strand, interfering with and inhibiting target-gene transcription while activating the reporter. The inversion approach is particularly applicable to single-exon genes and to genes in which the exon–intron structure is not clearly defined. This approach has been used to model an angiogenesis defect in delta-like 4 (<em id="""">Dll4</em>) knockout mice (Billard et al, 2012) and to generate immunological phenotypes in interleukin 2 receptor, gamma chain (<em id="""">Il2rg</em>) knockout mice (Economides et al, 2013).</li></ul><h3 id="""">References</h3><p id="""">MV Pulina, KE Sahr, S Nowotschin, MH Baron, AK Hadjantonakis. 2014. <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24596343/"" target=""_blank"" id="""">A conditional mutant allele for analysis of Mixl1 function in the mouse</a>. <em id="""">Genesis</em> <strong id="""">52</strong>(5): 417-23.</p><p id="""">K Liakath-Ali, VE Vancollie, E Heath, DP Smedley, J Estabel, D Sunter et al. 2014. <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24721909/"" target=""_blank"" id="""">Novel skin phenotypes revealed by a genome-wide mouse reverse genetic screen</a>. <em id="""">Nat Commun</em> <strong id="""">5</strong>: 3540.</p><p id="""">AN Economides, D Frendewey, P Yang, MG Dominguez, AT Dore, IB Lobov et al. 2013. <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23918385/"" target=""_blank"" id="""">Conditionals by inversion provide a universal method for the generation of conditional alleles</a>. <em id="""">Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A</em> <strong id="""">110</strong>(34): E3179-88.</p><p id="""">MJ Kane, M Angoa-Pérez, DI Briggs, DC Viano, CW Kreipke, DM Kuhn. 2012. <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21930157/"" target=""_blank"" id="""">A mouse model of human repetitive mild traumatic brain injury</a>. <em id="""">J Neurosci Methods</em> <strong id="""">203</strong>(1): 41-9.</p><p id="""">X Xu, KU Wagner, D Larson, Z Weaver, C Li, T Ried, L Hennighausen, A Wynshaw-Boris, CX Deng. 1999. <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10319859/"" target=""_blank"" id="""">Conditional mutation of Brca1 in mammary epithelial cells results in blunted ductal morphogenesis and tumour formation</a>. <em id="""">Nat Genet</em> <strong id="""">22</strong>(1): 37-43.</p><p>‍</p>",

As researchers continue to learn more about the human genome and the role that each gene plays in the body, transgenic and knockin mouse models continue to be essential by allowing scientists to assign functions to genes, dissect genetic pathways, and manipulate the cellular or biochemical properties of proteins. Knockin mice are generated by knocking in a gene at a specific location and are utilized to shed light on the complexity of the human genome and the subsequent genetic mutations caused by the knockin gene insertion. Knockin mouse models have become powerful reagents for modeling genetic disorders, understanding embryonic development and evaluating therapeutics.</p><h3 id="""">An Overview of the Gene Knockin Process</h3><p id="""">What is a knockin and why is it so useful in the world of genetic research and engineering? A knockin defines a biological model in which a gene sequence is inserted at a particular locus. This technology is often used for the creation of disease models. Knockins are typically used in any research field. Different types of knockins include constitutive knockins, humanization knockins, reporter/tag knockins, and targeting transgenics that utilize the Rosa26 locus which provides full control of the gene expression. Scientists often use ES cells to insert an entirely new gene into a particular locus within the genome. This targeted insertion can result in a genetic mutation. In order to study the development of diseases and their effects in vivo, researchers often use knockin laboratory mouse models.</p><h3 id="""">How Does the Gene Knockin Method Work?</h3><p id="""">What is a knockin gene replacement and how is it used? The process of creating a knockin animal – most often a knockin mouse – involves targeted gene replacement mostly through homologous recombination.

In the field of genetic research and drug development, scientists have been studying knockout genes in animal models, with DNA similar to that of humans, for years. However, while knockout mouse models have provided scientists with a window of opportunity to discover the functions of human genes and to study human diseases, the limitations posed by laboratory mice have been equally evident. Fortunately, during the past few years, scientists have developed new knockout rats with similar qualities as knockout mice.</p><p id="""">So, what is a knockout rat, and why are these animals needed when scientists already use knockout mice? According to numerous studies, rats are actually much closer physiologically to humans than mice. Although the human genome is quite different from the genetic makeup of knockout rat models, many rat genes are similar to those in human DNA. This makes it possible for genetic researchers to gain a greater understanding of human DNA and physiology by studying knockout genes in lab rats. Some of the best results have been obtained in studies examining the cardiovascular and autoimmune systems, as well as all areas of the body that are affected by diseases like diabetes, arthritis, or addictive disorders.</p><p id="""">Even though rat models have already been around for years, the idea of making knockout rats feasible and economically worthwhile wasn’t heavily pursued until 2008. The reason why rats were not as widely used in the past is because scientists found it extremely difficult to culture and work with their embryonic stem cells. That changed after gene editing tools became more prevalent, making it easier to generate knockout rats, which changed the face of genetic research as we knew it. Several new methods have been developed over the years, such as zinc-finger nuclease technology, TALENs technology and CRISPR. It’s possible to create knockout rat models through these means once knockout mutations are first created, and then later through the use and breeding of rat lines designed to express Cre recombinase at a tissue-specific level.</p><p id="""">What are knockout rat models and what are the benefits of using them in a study? The answer to this question is simple: knockout rats are rats that have a certain gene inactivated for the purpose of studying how it can influence all of the processes in the body. One clear advantage of knockout rats is that rats have already been used as part of laboratory experiments for many years. The body of knowledge available on rat physiology is extensive, allowing scientists to reach more accurate conclusions in translational research. Coupled with the advancements in genetic manipulation technologies during the past decade, knockout rats have become versatile, adaptable animal models to study, offering scientists invaluable knowledge in particular areas of rat and human physiology.</p><p id="""">The most efficient knockout rat models focus on a specific disease or feature a particular gene inactivation. That gene will be knocked out in the rat’s genome, while scientists will study the resulting behaviors and disorders as closely as possible. During an experiment, scientists will explore treatments and invent new methods of counteracting any adverse effects – or even go straight to the core of the problem by using gene therapies. The result is that knockout rat models have become some of the most essential and widely used animal models nowadays. Whether studying mutations or how a gene is linked to certain diseases, genetic scientists now possess a powerful tool in knockout rats.</p><p id="""">Using knockout rats, researchers have achieved many breakthroughs that might not have been previously possible with mouse models. So, in answering the question, “what is a knockout rat and why is it an important research tool,” scientists are now able use these rodents to reach more accurate conclusions and find treatments for diseases more efficiently. These animal models give researchers the ability to gather important information about the rat genome and the roles those genes play, not only in regulating physiological processes throughout the body, but also in inducing or eliminating certain disorders.</p><p id="""">The genetic origins often attributed to the onset of certain diseases have been a topic of debate among scientists for a long time. Today, with the help of knockout rat models, researchers can follow the onset, progression, and consequences of a variety of diseases, throughout generations of these animal models. This is for the purpose of finding cures and treatments that can then be adapted for treatment in humans.</p><p id="""">‍</p>",

Knowing this is extremely important for a clear understanding of mutations. Point mutations are typically known to be caused during DNA replication, and are thus a product of other genetic processes.</p><p id="""">Although most point mutations are considered to be more or less benign, there is usually a risk that they can lead to loss of protein function and ultimately, to various diseases. They can be random and even lethal in some cases. Depending on what caused the mutation, what type of mutation it is and how the organism responds to it, there are many potential repercussions that could affect the organism in question, some more negative than others.</p><h3 id="""">Qualities of Point Mutations</h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">A single point mutation occurs when a single base pair is substituted with another within the DNA</strong>, leading to numerous possibilities with regards to mutations at the protein level. Depending on the nature of the change, the resulting codon expression can vary from the original, leading to a significant change in the final resulting protein. Such missense amino acid changes can lead to an energetic and chemical balance throughout the entire organism. As a result, the protein losing its main function can cause disease. In many cases, the development of a similar or the same amino acid will not lead to anything serious. However, when it comes to missense mutations, this isn’t the case, and cancer is one of the main disorders that can result from this type of change.</p><h3 id="""">Using Targeted Single Mutations</h3><p id="""">Single point mutations can and have been used for a variety of different applications. In most cases, they are used in transgenic mice to help develop simple, easy to obtain but also highly targeted changes in the DNA encoding that accounts for certain diseases or their absence. As a result, the use of a single point mutation can lead to anything from the development of prostate cancer to an increase in immune system deficiencies, which can then be used to develop new potential treatments. For example, sickle cell anemia mice have single mutations consisting of mutations of Antilles b23-I and D-Punjab b121-N. These are known to enhance the polymerization process in sickle cell patients being bS-Antilles heterozygotes or compound S/D- Punjab heterozygotes.</p><h3 id="""">Differences Between Multiple and Single Point Mutations</h3><p id="""">Point mutations can occur not only in the DNA, but in the RNA as well. In humans, the double-stranded DNA and RNA are complementary in their function of generating the vital amino acids required for cells to thrive. However, when a multiple or single point mutation occurs, the result can lead to an alteration (or more) that can be difficult to trace or to fully understand. The difference between multiple and single point mutations is that the point mutation only alters one base of nucleotides, while multiple mutations can also affect entire sections of chromosomes. Multiple point mutations can also occur in a single strand of DNA or RNA.</p><h3 id="""">What Are Point Mutations In Genetic Research And What Can They Do?</h3><p id="""">So what is a point mutation, and why is it important when using animal models in research? <strong id="""">A point mutation mouse</strong> is a knockin mouse line in which one or more nucleotides in the mouse genome are substituted by variant nucleotides.</p><p id="""">This mutation can result in either an in-frame amino acid change of protein sequence or a frameshift mutation. The base pairs can either be deleted or added to the organism’s genetic code through a variety of means. Some might involve DNA replication, while others have to do with the effects of radiation, such as UV or X-rays. The end result and its complications aren’t always fully foreseeable, although new methods for predicting point mutations have improved in recent years. They can range between synonymous mutations (which are typically benign) to more complex frameshift mutations.</p><p id="""">The most serious impairment of gene function as a result of a point mutation will typically depend on the location of the mutation itself. If the mutation occurs in an area responsible for protein encoding then the damage can be severe, potentially leading to the loss of stability and/or function within the protein complex.</p><h3 id="""">Types Of Point Mutations</h3><p id="""">There are three types of DNA mutations: base substitutions, deletions and insertions.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Base Substitutions:</strong> When considering what a point mutation is, it’s also important to note that there are two other types of point mutations depending on whether there is a purine or pyrimidine base. The latter is known as a transition mutation, and the former is commonly named a transversion mutation. An example of a transition mutation is a GC base replacing a naturally occurring AT base pair. When it comes to transversion mutations, a pyrimidine base is <strong id="""">substituted by a purine base</strong>. In most cases, that translates as a TA or CG pair replacing a wild type AT pair.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Deletions:</strong> A deletion, resulting in a frameshift, occurs <strong id="""">when one or more base pairs are lost from the DNA.</strong> If one or two bases are deleted, the translational frame is altered resulting in a garbled message and nonfunctional product. A deletion of three or more bases leaves the reading frame intact. A deletion of one or more codons results in a protein missing one or more amino acids. This may be deleterious or not. An example in which a deletion of three nucleotides takes place in a recessive inherited disorder is cystic fibrosis. This deletion occurs &nbsp;in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regular gene, resulting in the loss of the amino acid phenylalanine and causing an incorrectly folded protein.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Insertions:</strong> The insertion of additional base pairs may lead to frameshifts depending on whether or not multiples of three base pairs are inserted. Combinations of insertions and deletions leading to a variety of outcomes are also possible. For example, if a sequence of codons in DNA is normally CCT ATG TTT and an extra A is added between the two cytosine bases, the sequence will instead read CAC TAT GTT T. This completely changes the amino acids that would be produced, which in turn alters the structure and function of the resulting protein and can render it useless.</p><h3 id="""">What Can Cause a Point Mutation?</h3><p id="""">A point mutation can develop when a double stranded DNA molecule creates two separate single strands. In addition, radiation and chemical reactions can result in a point mutation when the reactions are severe enough. Environmental properties such as extreme heat and other temperature changes may also be a factor. High frequency light can affect DNA due to its influence on ionizing electrons. This can lead to reactions between oxygen molecules and free radicals, which can be extremely detrimental to the DNA molecule.</p><h3 id="""">Examples Of Diseases Caused By Point Mutations</h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">Cystic Fibrosis</strong></p><p id="""">Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a recessive inherited disorder most common among people of European descent. In the United States, 1 in 3500 newborns are born with cystic fibrosis, and 1 in 30 Caucasian Americans is a carrier. There are many different mutations that can cause CF, but the most common one is a deletion of three nucleotides in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene that results in the loss of the amino acid phenylalanine and causes an incorrectly folded protein. (Note that this deletion is not a frameshift mutation because three bases next to each other are deleted, and all the other amino acids in the chain remain the same.) CF is associated with thick, sticky mucus in the lungs and trouble breathing, salty sweat, infertility in certain individuals, and a shortened life expectancy (about 42-50 years in developed countries).</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Sickle-Cell Anemia</strong></p><p id="""">Sickle-cell anemia is a recessive disorder caused by a single substitution in the gene that creates hemoglobin, which carries oxygen in the <a href=""https://biologydictionary.net/blood/"" target=""_blank"" id="""">blood</a>. Normally, <a href=""https://biologydictionary.net/glutamic-acid/"" target=""_blank"" id="""">glutamic acid</a> is produced in the chain, but the substitution causes valine to be produced at that spot instead. When people have two copies of this mutation, it results in thin sickle-shaped blood cells that sometimes cannot carry oxygen properly. About 80% of people with sickle-cell disease are in sub-Saharan Africa, where being a carrier for sickle-cell anemia (having only one copy of the gene, not two) actually helps protect against malaria. It is also found in other parts of the world such as India and the Middle East, and affects about 1 in 500 African Americans. Symptoms include anemia, obstruction of blood vessels, and chest pain, and it is treated with folic acid, blood transfusions, bone marrow transplants, and certain prescription drugs.</p><h3 id="""">How Point Mutations Can Go Wrong</h3><p id="""">A good example of what a single point mutation can lead to happens in the case of converting the GAG codon into GUG. This would lead to the encoding of amino acid valine instead of glutamic acid. In some cases, activation of the RAF protein is also possible due to the protein exhibiting increased function. When that happens, unlimited proliferative signaling in cancer cells can lead to the development of a severe form of cancer.</p><p id="""">Another example could be chemical damage to DNA. There are many chemical mutagens that are exogenous, man-made, or environmental that are capable of damaging DNA. Many chemotherapeutic drugs and intercalating agent drugs function by damaging DNA.</p><h3 id="""">Mutation vs. Adaptation</h3><p id="""">Not all mutations are neutral or negative. In some cases, they can lead to positive changes, such as germline mutations that may protect the organism and will then be passed down through multiple generations. In this case, point mutations can actually be a viable explanation for the theory of evolution, to explain how certain changes occurred in the genetic makeup of evolving organisms.</p><h3 id="""">Why Mouse Models are an Important Research Tool To Understanding Mutations</h3><p id="""">With modern sequencing and genomic engineering technologies, the precise mutation(s) underlying human disease can be introduced into mice, yielding more accurate and useful disease research data. &nbsp;Through the years, the mouse model has proven to be the best way to reproduce human disease when due to mutations. &nbsp;There has been high physiological relevance of the scientific data obtained from the mouse model and it is a cleaner way than the classical knockout mouse model where the whole gene is deleted. &nbsp;In addition, the phenotype is due only to the mutation: &nbsp;alteration of a single function without disturbing other domains of a protein.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Related Posts</strong></p><p>‍</p>",

Stem cell lines are the basis of a science that has been around since the early 1980s, when scientists first managed to derive stem cells from mouse embryos. Since then, the study of stem cells has evolved to a great extent, as breakthroughs were made to derive and use human stem cells from embryos as well as adults.</p><h3 id="""">What Are Stem Cell Lines?</h3><p id="""">A stem cell line is essentially a group of stem cells that is cultured for various purposes using in-vitro methods. Stem cell lines are commonly used in genetic research and regenerative medicine, and they have already led to countless breakthroughs that would not have been possible by using other types of cells. Because of stem cells’ unique ability to renew themselves as they divide, they can essentially multiply to an indefinite extent, which is part of why they are so valuable.</p><h3 id="""">Stem Lines and Their Main Purpose</h3><p id="""">Of course, stem cells don’t multiply like immortalized cell lines that lose their ability to halt their regenerative properties due to mutation. Instead, stem cells, whether they develop in-vitro through stem cell lines, or whether they are used by the body internally to repair or build important elements of itself, propagate as a result of their inherent, natural properties. Stem cell lines retain the stem cells’ original genetic qualities, while still dividing virtually indefinitely. Also, another important property, and one that could lead to major medical breakthroughs, is the fact that stem cells are multipotent, as they are capable of taking the role of any other specialized cells.</p><h3 id="""">Types of Stem Cell Lines</h3><p id="""">There are three types of stem cell lines: those cultured from embryos, those derived through adult stem cells and those that are generated as a result of induced stem cell research. Embryonic cells are the easiest to culture, since stem cells are present in abundance in the embryos of any species. In humans, in the case of a 5-day old embryo, these inner cells give rise to the entire cellular diversity of the body. Adult stem cells still exist, despite the fact that the body is fully developed. These cells are primarily used for repairing cellular damage in certain areas, and can also be cultured in-vitro. In the case of induced stem cells, the process is more complex. These are stem cell lines derived from adult somatic, reproductive or pluripotent cell types through the use of artificial genetic reprogramming.</p><h3 id="""">Embryonic vs. Non-Embryonic Stem Cells</h3><p id="""">While there are many differences between embryonic and non-embryonic stem cells, most researchers find them both to be equally useful in anything from growing a basic stem line to genetic therapy. Some studies show that non-embryonic stem cells might not be able to reproduce as easily as embryonic ones and that scientists still haven’t found adult cells that could develop all types of tissues. Moreover, embryonic cells don’t usually contain as many abnormalities caused by toxins, sunlight and other factors that tend to affect non-embryonic cells.</p><h3 id="""">The Current Advantages of Adult Stem Cells</h3><p id="""">Which types of stem cells are better to use in a research environment, and which have the greatest potential for practical applications? Although embryonic stem cells hold the most potential due to their ability to transform into any other type of cell the body needs, they are notoriously difficult to control. As a result, scientists have barely begun to scratch the surface on how they can be reprogrammed to serve specific purposes. On the other hand, multipotent adult stem cells can still offer a practical level of flexibility that scientists can use without the added ethical issues or technical difficulties associated with embryonic cells. New findings and studies conducted with the help of animal test subjects have confirmed that stem cells still have a great potential to adapt to new roles, even after they have begun to specialize. Ultimately, it’s easy to see how both adult and embryonic cell lines might be suited for different types of research.</p><h3 id="""">What Are the Best Approaches to Using a Stem Line for Research?</h3><p id="""">Using stem cells to research better ways to fight disease has widely been considered a successful endeavor, leading to future, continued use of stem cell lines in medicine.Although learning about these cell lines and their potential is a slow process, there are promising possibilities on the horizon, as well as many significant breakthroughs that have already been made. It is important, therefore, to put stem cell research into perspective and view its remarkable potential together with its drawbacks and current limitations.</p><h3 id="""">Common Problems That Could Be Solved with Stem Cell Research</h3><p id="""">One major problem that doctors face when attempting an organ transplant is the tendency of the patient’s immune system to respond by rejecting the new organ. This is a common and sometimes fatal complication that has yet to be resolved in all cases. Stem cell research could lead to its resolution through the modification of human stem cell lines and the combination of stem cell and genetic therapies. Also, a great advantage of using stem cells is that their growth potential is virtually immeasurable. Once a stem cell line is initiated, it will continue growing, unless the cell culture is frozen or artificial limitations are set in place.</p><h3 id="""">Practical Stem Cell Line Applications in Use Today</h3><p id="""">Adult stem cells are most commonly used as part of revolutionary therapies that deliver reprogramming factors into the body’s cells. Controlled viruses are already being used to achieve this goal, and scientists are looking into the possibility of curing genetic diseases with their help. However, some researchers are still extremely cautious when it comes to using such techniques on human subjects, due to the complications they have posed during animal trial experiments.</p><p>‍</p>",

The concept of a transgene has been broadly understood for more than 100 years, as the advent of genetic research made its way into the 20th century. As time went by, technologies evolved, and transgenes became widely used during the late 1970s and early ‘80s. Transgenes are pieces of genetic material that are used to modify the genome of a certain organism. The modification of the organism’s phenotype is also possible through the use of transgenes. In order to function properly, transgenes require several key components. The promoter is a regulatory sequence that determines where and when the transgene will be activated, while the exon is in charge of protein-coding sequence and the stop sequence. A third element is the bacterial plasmid that is used to deliver these components to the host genome.</p><p id=""""><em id="""">“The project was very well managed…in fact, using iTL validated my decision to not try and do this in my own lab.

The valuable research gathered from the development of humanized transgenic mice, for example, has been used to develop new treatments for cancer and other, equally debilitating disorders. Advancements in molecular biology allow for new models to be developed, helping scientists study the human genome more closely and conditions such as aging, diabetes, infertility and immune response.</p><h3 id="""">The First Transgenic Organisms</h3><p id="""">The first transgene to be obtained in controlled conditions through specific, genetic manipulation methods was in 1974.

New mouse models are also being developed on a regular basis, the oncomouse being an entirely new genetically modified mouse species developed for the study of cancer. Considering the issue “what is a transgene and what should we expect in the future,” researchers also point to potential applications like the xenotransplantation of organs, the development of artificial protein-based foods and a cure for fertility-related genetic disorders.</p><p id="""">‍</p>",

Although we do not look alike, on a genetic level mouse genes are very similar to our own, making mouse genetic research useful for studying human disease. By utilizing humanized mice, we have gained valuable insight into how human systems work which has allowed us to develop new and important therapies.</p><h4 id="""">Some facts about mice that you may not know:</h4><ul id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Adult mice multiply quickly.</strong> They can reproduce as often as every three weeks, and they can mate on the day they give birth – very different than humans but extremely beneficial to our understanding of human disease. Scientists are easily able to generate a lot of mice to work with.</li><li id="""">The mouse is <strong id="""">small</strong> compared to other potential animal models, which makes them more convenient to take care of for research purposes.</li><li id="""">The time between a mouse being born and giving birth is <strong id="""">short</strong>, usually about <strong id="""">10 weeks</strong> (compared to humans where it takes us about 10 months to deliver a baby). This means several mouse generations can be observed at once.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">The mouse has a short lifespan of one year</strong>, which in terms of aging equals about 30 human years. This gives scientists the ability to measure the effects of human aging more easily by using mice.</li><li id="""">Mice are used to study complex biological systems found in humans, such as the immune, hormonal, nervous, cardiovascular and skeletal systems. This is because like humans, <strong id="""">mice naturally develop diseases</strong> that affect these systems too – including diseases such as cancer and diabetes. Also, mice can get infected with the same viruses as humans, such as <strong id="""">HIV</strong> or <strong id="""">COVID-19</strong>, and so mice can be studied to develop better human therapies for these viruses.</li><li id="""">Compared to other potential animal model systems, it is relatively <strong id="""">easy to manipulate the mouse genome</strong>, for example, adding or removing a gene to better understand its role in the body. This ability has provided an enormously powerful tool for modeling specific diseases when a mutated human gene can be observed in the mouse.</li><li id="""">Humanized mouse models are extremely useful for studying complex diseases, such as atherosclerosis and hypertension, as many of the genes responsible for these diseases are <strong id="""">shared between mice and humans</strong>. Research in mice provides insights into the genetic risk factors for these diseases in humans.</li></ul><h4 id="""">3 main types of humanized mice</h4><h5 id="""">Tumor mouse models</h5><p id="""">Immunodeficient mice (mice without a fully functioning immune system) can be used as hosts to grow both normal and diseased human tissue. Most notable, patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mouse models involve the direct transfer of human tumors into immunodeficient mice following surgical removal of the tumor/cells from the patient. The PDX mouse can be used in precision medicine, which is the customization of treatments that are tailored specifically to the patient instead of a one‐drug‐fits‐all model. For example, the PDX mouse can be used in individualized cancer therapy and drug development that specifically meets the need of the human patient to which the cancer came from rather than a more generalized approach that would be used without the aid of the PDX model.</p><h5 id="""">Immune system mice</h5><p id="""">Humanized immune system mice, or models that express human versions of mouse immune genes, can be used to model the human immune system, enabling the evaluation of therapies relevant to human health in an in vivo environment. More recently, mice with humanized immune systems have been used in COVID-19 studies in order to evaluate treatments and develop vaccines during the pandemic. These models often target the ACE2 receptor, also humanized in the mouse, allowing for a more accurate human infection that scientists can study.</p><h5 id="""">Gene targeted mice</h5><p id="""">Many human diseases are known to be caused in part by specific mutations in human genes. In order to better understand how mutation leads to disease, mouse models can be made in which the human mutation is inserted into the analogous mouse gene. This is achieved through a process called gene targeting, where a portion of the mouse gene is replaced with a homologous piece of DNA containing the human mutation. The subsequent mouse offspring can be utilized to study the human mutation, determine the course of disease and test potential therapies for the disease.</p><p id="""">One example of how mouse models can be used to study human disease is in a recent publication by <strong id="""">Ann-Louise Vikberg</strong>, et. al., from the <strong id="""">University of Umeå, Sweden</strong>. A human mutation in the Kif23 gene is known to cause a rare form of congenital anemia and a prevalence for blood cancers. The group created a mouse model through <strong id="""">ingenious targeting laboratory</strong> where the human mutation was inserted into the analogous mouse gene. The humanized mouse model was used to study the mutant Kif23 gene in different tissue types including bone marrow, a difficult tissue to study in humans. The ability to use the humanized mouse model as a means of studying the mutant gene in this difficult tissue type allowed the researchers to gain insights that they would not have been able to gain easily from human patients, concluding that tissue-specific expression of KIF23 variants can influence the anemia phenotype.</p><p id="""">These reasons, and more, put humanized mouse models at the top of the list as the animal model of choice for studying human disease.

As part of this Phase II application, our team will provide flexibility to those who wish to avoid complications with immunogenicity by inserting human VHs with select mutations that confer camelid-like properties. One goal of the program is to demonstrate positive HCAb discovery and functionality based on usage of a minimum of 3 model antigens (HIV-1 gp120, SARS CoV2 Spike, and a novel Enterobacter antigen). This will be accomplished with the guidance from Dr. Sergei Koralov, who is partnering with his NYU colleagues Dr. Victor Torres, C.V.
