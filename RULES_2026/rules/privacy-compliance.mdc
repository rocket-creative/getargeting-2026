## Consent-First Privacy & Compliance Baseline

This repo must be **consent-first**. Tracking is denied by default.

### REQUIRED (High Level)
- No analytics, ads, pixels, or non-essential tracking until the user gives explicit consent.
- Consent must be granular by category at minimum:
  - Necessary (always on)
  - Preferences
  - Analytics
  - Marketing
- Provide a preference center and allow changes at any time.
- Provide an always-accessible "Cookie Settings" control.
- Honor Global Privacy Control (GPC) by treating it as an opt-out signal.
- Do not use dark patterns:
  - No pre-checked boxes
  - No disguised buttons
  - No unequal prominence (Accept vs Reject must be equal prominence)
  - No forced consent walls unless explicitly allowed by jurisdiction/business rules

### REQUIRED (Operational)
- Store consent choices (with versioning) and apply them consistently.
- Consent renewal window: 12–13 months (or per applicable rule); re-prompt when required.
- If a tag manager is present, it must be category-gated.

### REQUIRED (Documentation)
- Maintain a cookie registry / declaration mechanism (even if initially empty).
- Maintain privacy policy and cookie policy links in the footer.

### FORBIDDEN
- Loading non-essential scripts prior to consent
- "Implied consent" patterns
- Bundling marketing with analytics without separate control
