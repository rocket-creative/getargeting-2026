## Accessibility Gates (WCAG 2.1 AA Minimum)

### REQUIRED
- Keyboard navigation for all interactive elements.

- Form controls must have labels; errors must be announced and associated.
- Color contrast must meet WCAG AA.
- Modals/menus must trap focus appropriately and restore focus on close.
- Images must have appropriate alt text (decorative images must be empty alt).

### TESTING GATES (Minimum)
- Run an automated check (e.g., axe) in CI or during verification steps when feasible.
- Manual spot-check: tab order, focus, form errors, modal behavior.

### FORBIDDEN
- Click-only interactions without keyboard equivalents.
- Placeholder-only labels for inputs.
