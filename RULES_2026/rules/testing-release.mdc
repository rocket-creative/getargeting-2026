## Testing, Deployment Safety, and No-Regressions

### REQUIRED
- Define a minimum verification checklist for every change:
  - build
  - lint
  - tests (if present)
  - consent gating validation (if tracking present)
  - accessibility spot check
  - security headers verification (deployment environment)

### NO-REGRESSION RULE
- Future updates MUST NOT negatively impact:
  - existing authenticated users
  - session continuity (when expected)
  - previously working flows

### CHANGE SAFETY
- Prefer incremental changes over large refactors.
- If a refactor is necessary, isolate it and provide a migration plan.

### FORBIDDEN
- Breaking changes without a migration path
- Removing validation or tests to pass CI
