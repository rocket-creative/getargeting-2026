## Coding Style & Consistency

### REQUIRED
- TypeScript strict mode (no implicit any).
- Prefer explicit types for public APIs and exported functions.
- Keep functions small and single-purpose.
- Use early returns; avoid deep nesting.
- Never leave dead code or commented-out blocks in production paths.
- Prefer clear naming over clever naming.

### FILE/PROJECT CONVENTIONS
- Use predictable folder structure.
- Keep shared utilities in a single `lib/` or `utils/` area.
- Avoid cyclic imports.

### OUTPUT CONVENTIONS (AI)
- Every change must include an AI Change Log (see `docs/AI_CHANGELOG_TEMPLATE.mdc`).
- Provide verification commands whenever proposing code changes.

### FORBIDDEN
- Introducing dependencies without justification.
- Copy-pasting large patterns without adapting to project structure.
