Oncology Mouse Models
Since 1998, Ingenious Targeting Laboratory has supported oncology researchers with custom mouse models contributing to peer reviewed publications in Cancer Cell, Cancer Research, Nature Medicine, and leading oncology journals worldwide. Our oncology mouse models have advanced understanding of tumor biology, cancer genetics, and therapeutic response across solid tumors and hematological malignancies.
Oncology mouse models enable researchers to investigate the genetic drivers of cancer, study tumor microenvironment interactions, and evaluate therapeutic approaches in immunocompetent systems. From conditional tumor suppressor knockouts that initiate tissue specific tumors to oncogene knockins expressing driver mutations at physiological levels, the right model design is critical for understanding cancer biology and developing effective treatments.
Genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) provide advantages over transplantation models by recapitulating tumor initiation, progression, and microenvironment interactions in their native context. Ingenious Targeting Laboratory designs and generates custom oncology models tailored to your specific research questions and therapeutic development goals.

Frequently Asked Questions
What is the difference between a tumor suppressor knockout and an oncogene knockin?
A tumor suppressor knockout eliminates a gene that normally prevents tumor formation (e.g., p53, PTEN). An oncogene knockin introduces an activating mutation that promotes tumor development (e.g., KRAS G12D, BRAF V600E). Both approaches model different aspects of cancer biology and can be combined in the same mouse.
Can I use conditional alleles for cancer modeling?
Yes. Conditional alleles are essential for many cancer models because tumor suppressor genes often cause embryonic lethality when deleted globally. Tissue-specific conditional knockout using Cre drivers enables tumor formation in specific organs while avoiding developmental defects.
What Cre drivers are commonly used for oncology models?
Common Cre drivers include tissue-specific promoters (e.g., Albumin-Cre for liver, Kras-Cre for pancreas, MMTV-Cre for mammary gland) and inducible Cre systems (e.g., CreERT2 with tamoxifen) for temporal control of tumor initiation. Selection depends on your target tissue and experimental design.
How do I choose between syngeneic tumor models and genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM)?
Syngeneic models involve injecting tumor cell lines into immunocompetent mice and are faster for immunotherapy studies. GEMMs develop tumors spontaneously from defined genetic alterations and better recapitulate tumor evolution and microenvironment. GEMMs require longer timelines but provide more physiologically relevant models.
What strain background should I use for oncology models?
C57BL/6 is most common for immuno-oncology studies and is compatible with MC38 and B16 syngeneic tumors. BALB/c is used for CT26 and 4T1 tumors. Strain selection affects immune response and tumor growth characteristics, so choose based on your experimental requirements.
