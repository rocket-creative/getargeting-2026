Humanized Immune Checkpoint Mice
Since 1998, Ingenious Targeting Laboratory has generated custom mouse models, including humanized immune checkpoint models, enabling preclinical testing of checkpoint inhibitor antibodies and combination immunotherapies. These models express human checkpoint proteins in immunocompetent mice, providing platforms for evaluating human specific therapeutics in the context of functional immune systems.
Ingenious Targeting Laboratory offers humanized models for PD1, PDL1, CTLA4, LAG3, TIM3, and other immune checkpoints as single humanizations or in combinations designed for your specific immunotherapy development program.
Immune Checkpoint Biology
Immune checkpoints are regulatory proteins that modulate T cell activation and function. Under normal conditions, checkpoints prevent autoimmunity by limiting immune responses. Tumors exploit checkpoint pathways to evade immune surveillance.
Checkpoint Inhibitor Immunotherapy
Blocking checkpoint proteins with therapeutic antibodies releases the brakes on antitumor immunity. Checkpoint inhibitors have revolutionized cancer treatment, with durable responses in multiple tumor types.
Clinical checkpoint inhibitors target human proteins and typically do not cross react with mouse orthologs. Humanized checkpoint mice solve this problem by expressing human targets.
Species Specificity Challenge
Therapeutic antibodies are engineered for high affinity binding to human proteins. Minor sequence differences between human and mouse checkpoint proteins often prevent antibody binding to mouse orthologs. Humanized models expressing human checkpoints enable preclinical efficacy testing.
Available Checkpoint Models
PD1 Humanized Mice
Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1, PDCD1) is expressed on activated T cells. PD1 engagement by its ligands PDL1 and PDL2 suppresses T cell function. Humanized PD1 mice enable testing of anti PD1 antibodies including pembrolizumab and nivolumab.
(/pd1-humanized-mice)
PDL1 Humanized Mice
Programmed death ligand 1 (PDL1, CD274) is expressed on tumor cells and antigen presenting cells. PDL1 humanized mice enable testing of anti PDL1 antibodies including atezolizumab, durvalumab, and avelumab.
(/pdl1-humanized-mice)
CTLA4 Humanized Mice
Cytotoxic T lymphocyte associated protein 4 (CTLA4) competes with CD28 for B7 ligand binding, suppressing T cell activation. CTLA4 humanized mice enable testing of anti CTLA4 antibodies including ipilimumab.
(/ctla4-humanized-mice)
LAG3 Humanized Mice
Lymphocyte activation gene 3 (LAG3, CD223) binds MHC class II and negatively regulates T cell function. LAG3 humanized mice support development of anti LAG3 antibodies in development as single agents and in combination with PD1 blockade.
(/lag3-humanized-mice)
TIM3 Humanized Mice
T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain containing protein 3 (TIM3, HAVCR2) is expressed on exhausted T cells and regulatory T cells. TIM3 humanized mice enable testing of anti TIM3 antibodies as emerging checkpoint targets.

Combination Checkpoint Models
Double Immune Checkpoint Humanization
Combination immune checkpoint blockade often shows enhanced efficacy compared to single agent therapy. Double humanized mice expressing two human checkpoints enable preclinical testing of combination immunotherapy approaches.
Combinations include PD1/CTLA4 double humanized mice for testing combinations similar to nivolumab plus ipilimumab, and PD1/LAG3 double humanized mice for next generation combinations.
Triple and Multi Checkpoint Models
As checkpoint inhibitor combinations become more complex, models with three or more humanized checkpoints enable testing of multi agent regimens.
Custom Checkpoint Combinations
Ingenious Targeting Laboratory can generate custom checkpoint combinations tailored to your specific immunotherapy development program.
Humanization Strategy
Extracellular Domain Humanization
The most common approach humanizes the extracellular domain where therapeutic antibodies bind while retaining mouse transmembrane and intracellular domains. This design maintains normal signaling while enabling human antibody binding.
Complete Gene Replacement
Complete replacement with the human gene provides a fully humanized target. This approach may be preferred when studying antibodies that also modulate signaling or when complete humanization is required.
Tumor Model Compatibility
Humanized checkpoint mice are generated on C57BL/6 background, providing compatibility with established syngeneic tumor models.
Compatible Tumor Lines
C57BL/6 compatible tumor lines include MC38 (colon carcinoma), B16 (melanoma), E0771 (breast carcinoma), and Lewis lung carcinoma. These models enable evaluation of checkpoint inhibitor efficacy across tumor types.
Study Design
Standard efficacy studies involve tumor implantation followed by antibody treatment. Endpoints include tumor growth, survival, and immune correlates including tumor infiltrating lymphocyte analysis.

Frequently Asked Questions
Why do I need humanized checkpoint models instead of using mouse checkpoint inhibitors?
Most clinical checkpoint inhibitor antibodies are designed to target human proteins and do not cross-react with mouse orthologs. Humanized checkpoint models express human PD1, PDL1, CTLA4, or other targets, enabling efficacy testing of clinical antibodies in immunocompetent mice with functional immune systems. This is essential for preclinical immunotherapy development.
What checkpoint models are available as catalog models?
Ingenious Targeting Laboratory offers humanized models for PD1, PDL1, CTLA4, LAG3, TIM3, and other checkpoints, as well as single and dual checkpoint combinations. Catalog models provide study-ready mice with shorter lead times than custom projects. Availability and pricing are confirmed upon inquiry.
Can I combine multiple humanized checkpoints in one mouse?
Yes. Dual or triple humanized checkpoint mice are commonly used for combination therapy studies. For example, PD1/CTLA4 double humanized mice enable testing of dual checkpoint blockade, which is increasingly important in clinical practice. Multiple humanizations can be combined through breeding or sequential targeting.
What syngeneic tumors can I use with humanized checkpoint models?
Humanized checkpoint models on C57BL/6 background are compatible with MC38 (colon carcinoma), B16 (melanoma), E0771 (breast carcinoma), and Lewis lung carcinoma. BALB/c models are compatible with CT26 and 4T1 tumors. Syngeneic tumor compatibility enables evaluation of checkpoint inhibitors in immunocompetent mice with functional immune systems.
