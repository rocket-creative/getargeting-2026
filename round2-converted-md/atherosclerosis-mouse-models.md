Atherosclerosis Mouse Models
Since 1998, ingenious targeting laboratory has supported cardiovascular research with custom atherosclerosis mouse models enabling mechanistic studies of plaque development, lipid metabolism, and therapeutic interventions targeting the leading cause of death worldwide.
Atherosclerosis mouse models provide essential platforms for investigating the molecular pathways underlying plaque initiation and progression, testing hypotheses about inflammation and lipid handling, and developing therapies for coronary artery disease and stroke prevention.
Understanding Atherosclerosis
Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the arterial wall characterized by lipid accumulation, immune cell infiltration, and plaque formation. Mouse models enable controlled study of disease mechanisms.
Disease Progression
Fatty Streak Formation
Early lesions with lipid laden macrophages (foam cells) in the intima.
Plaque Development
Progressive accumulation of lipids, inflammatory cells, and smooth muscle cells. Formation of fibrous cap.
Advanced Lesions
Necrotic core development, calcification, and potential for plaque rupture and thrombosis.
Key Pathogenic Mechanisms
Lipid Accumulation
Elevated LDL cholesterol enters arterial wall and undergoes oxidation.
Inflammation
Monocyte recruitment, macrophage activation, and inflammatory cytokine production.
Foam Cell Formation
Macrophages take up modified lipids, becoming foam cells.
Smooth Muscle Proliferation
Vascular smooth muscle cells migrate and proliferate, forming fibrous cap.
ApoE Knockout Model
The most widely used atherosclerosis model:
Genetic Basis
ApoE Function
Apolipoprotein E mediates hepatic clearance of lipoprotein remnants. Loss causes accumulation of atherogenic lipoproteins.
Spontaneous Atherosclerosis
ApoE knockout mice develop atherosclerosis on normal chow diet, accelerated by Western diet.
Phenotype
Lipid Profile
Marked hypercholesterolemia (~400 mg/dL on chow, higher on Western diet). Elevated VLDL and IDL.
Lesion Development
Fatty streaks visible by 10 weeks on chow. Advanced plaques with Western diet.
Lesion Locations
Aortic root, aortic arch, brachiocephalic artery, and other branch points.
Applications
Standard Atherosclerosis Model
Widely used for mechanistic studies and drug testing.
Gene Interaction Studies
Cross with other knockouts to study gene contributions.
Dietary Studies
Responsive to dietary intervention.
LDLR Knockout Model
Alternative lipoprotein metabolism model:
Genetic Basis
LDLR Function
LDL receptor clears LDL cholesterol from circulation. Loss causes LDL accumulation.
Diet Dependent
LDLR knockout mice require Western diet for significant atherosclerosis.
Phenotype
Lipid Profile
Elevated LDL cholesterol, particularly on high fat/high cholesterol diet. More similar to human lipid profile than ApoE knockout.
Lesion Development
Minimal on chow diet. Robust atherosclerosis on Western diet.
Applications
Human Relevant Model
LDL elevation more closely mimics human familial hypercholesterolemia.
Drug Development
Testing LDL lowering therapies including PCSK9 inhibitors.
Combined and Enhanced Models
Double Knockout Models
ApoE/LDLR Double Knockout
Severe hyperlipidemia and accelerated atherosclerosis.
ApoE/SR-B1 Double Knockout
Develops coronary atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction. More clinically relevant disease.
Enhanced Instability Models
Standard mouse models develop stable plaques. Enhanced models address plaque vulnerability:
Fibrillin 1 Mutations
ApoE knockout with fibrillin 1 C1039G mutation develops unstable plaques.
Tandem Stenosis
Surgical model inducing plaque instability in ApoE knockout.
AAV PCSK9 Model
Mechanism
AAV delivery of PCSK9 gain of function variant degrades LDLR, inducing hypercholesterolemia.
Advantages
Can be used in any genetic background. Avoids need for germline modification.
Model Design Considerations
Background Strain
Atherosclerosis susceptibility varies with background:
C57BL/6
Highly susceptible to atherosclerosis when combined with ApoE or LDLR deficiency.
BALB/c
Relatively resistant to atherosclerosis.
FVB/N
Intermediate susceptibility.

Dietary Considerations
Normal Chow
ApoE knockout develops lesions on normal diet. LDLR knockout requires high fat diet.
Western Diet
High fat (21%), high cholesterol (0.15 to 0.2%) accelerates disease.
Paigen Diet
High fat, high cholesterol with cholic acid for severe hypercholesterolemia.
Sex Differences
Female Protection
Premenopausal females may show reduced atherosclerosis (estrogen protective effect).
Matched Studies
Use sex matched cohorts or study both sexes.
Conditional Approaches
Cell type specific gene manipulation:
Vascular Endothelium
Cdh5 Cre (VE Cadherin Cre)
Endothelial cell specific deletion for endothelial function studies.
Tie2 Cre
Endothelial and hematopoietic lineages.
Macrophages
LysM Cre
Myeloid cell targeting for foam cell and inflammatory studies.
CX3CR1 Cre
Monocyte/macrophage specific.
Smooth Muscle
SM22 Cre (Tagln Cre)
Smooth muscle cell specific deletion.
Myh11 Cre
Alternative smooth muscle driver.
Hepatocytes
Albumin Cre
Liver specific for lipid metabolism genes.

Frequently Asked Questions
What genetic backgrounds are used for atherosclerosis models?
Atherosclerosis models typically combine conditional gene modifications with hyperlipidemic backgrounds. ApoE knockout develops lesions on normal diet. LDLR knockout requires high-fat diet. Both are commonly used on C57BL/6 background, which is highly susceptible to diet-induced atherosclerosis.
What Cre drivers are used for cell-type-specific atherosclerosis studies?
Common Cre drivers include LysM-Cre (macrophages/foam cells), Tie2-Cre or Cdh5-Cre (endothelial cells), SM22-Cre (smooth muscle cells), and Albumin-Cre (hepatocytes for lipid metabolism). Selection depends on whether you're studying plaque formation, inflammation, vascular remodeling, or lipid metabolism.
How long do atherosclerosis studies take?
Lesion development depends on genetic background and diet. ApoE knockout on normal diet shows lesions in 12-16 weeks. LDLR knockout on high-fat diet requires 12-16 weeks. Western diet accelerates disease. More advanced lesions and plaque instability studies require longer timelines (20-30 weeks).
Can you combine multiple gene modifications for atherosclerosis research?
Yes. ITL can combine conditional gene modifications with hyperlipidemic backgrounds and additional genetic modifications. For example, macrophage-specific knockout on ApoE-/- background enables study of how specific genes affect plaque formation and inflammation in atherogenic context.
