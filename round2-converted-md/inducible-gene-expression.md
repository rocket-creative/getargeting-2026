Inducible Gene Expression
Since 1998, Ingenious Targeting Laboratory has incorporated inducible expression systems into hundreds of mouse models, enabling researchers to control gene activation or deletion with temporal precision through small molecule administration.
Inducible gene expression systems provide the ability to turn genes on or off at any point in the animal's life. This temporal control separates developmental requirements from adult functions, enables study of acute gene loss, and models therapeutic intervention timing for drug development.
Why Inducible Control Matters
Overcoming Embryonic Lethality
Constitutive Knockout Limitation: Essential genes deleted from conception often cause embryonic or perinatal death, preventing adult phenotype analysis.
Inducible Solution: Induce gene deletion in adults after development completes. Study adult function of developmentally essential genes.
Distinguishing Developmental vs Adult Function
Constitutive Knockout Limitation: Lifelong gene absence conflates developmental defects with adult requirements. Phenotype may reflect developmental abnormality rather than adult function.
Inducible Solution: Delete gene in fully developed adults. Observe acute consequences separate from developmental compensation.
Modeling Therapeutic Intervention
Drug Development Relevance: Therapeutics inhibit targets in adult patients, not from conception.
Inducible Solution: Induce deletion at disease relevant timepoints. Model drug effect timing and therapeutic window.
Major Inducible Systems
Tamoxifen Inducible (CreERT2)
The most widely used inducible system for conditional gene deletion:
Mechanism: Cre recombinase fused to mutant estrogen receptor (ERT2). Fusion protein sequestered in cytoplasm by heat shock proteins. Tamoxifen binding releases Cre to enter nucleus and perform recombination.
Induction: Tamoxifen or 4 hydroxytamoxifen administered by IP injection, oral gavage, or tamoxifen diet. Typical regimen is 5 consecutive days.
Kinetics: Recombination occurs within days of tamoxifen administration. Effect is permanent and irreversible.
Advantages: Single administration creates permanent genetic change. Wide variety of tissue specific CreERT2 lines available. Well characterized and reliable.
Considerations: Tamoxifen has estrogenic effects that may confound some studies. Incomplete recombination may occur in some tissues. Background recombination possible without tamoxifen (leakiness).

F.A.S.T.™ Technology (Flexible Accelerated STOP Tetracycline Operator)
Ingenious Targeting Laboratory offers F.A.S.T.™ technology, a versatile inducible/reversible system that provides flexible control over gene expression:
F.A.S.T.™ System Components: The F.A.S.T.™ cassette combines tetracycline operator elements with a STOP cassette, enabling multiple expression modes from a single knockin allele:
	•	Knockout First Mode**: Initial allele functions as a null, with gene function rescued by crossing to tissue specific Cre lines
	•	Inducible Expression Mode**: Gene expression induced through tetracycline transactivator (tTA) lines for ectopic or tissue specific overexpression
	•	Conditional Knockdown/Knockout Mode**: Gene expression silenced using tetracycline trans silencer lines for tissue specific conditional knockdown
Advantages: F.A.S.T.™ provides a spectrum of controllable expression levels, streamlining mouse model generation by enabling multiple experimental approaches from a single targeted allele. This flexibility makes F.A.S.T.™ ideal for genes where both knockout and overexpression studies are planned.
Applications: F.A.S.T.™ has been successfully used in neuroscience, immunology, and metabolic disease research, enabling researchers to study gene function through both loss and gain of function approaches using the same mouse line.

Other Inducible Systems
Rapamycin Inducible (FRB/FKBP): Dimerization system where rapamycin brings together FRB and FKBP domains. Less commonly used due to rapamycin's immunosuppressive effects.
Hormone Inducible (Other): Progesterone and glucocorticoid receptor fusions available but less widely adopted than tamoxifen system.
Light Inducible (Optogenetics): Emerging systems using light activated proteins. Primarily for acute, reversible control in accessible tissues.

When to Use Tamoxifen Inducible
Gene Knockout Studies: Delete endogenous genes at specific timepoints using CreERT2 with floxed alleles.
Lineage Tracing: Permanently mark cell populations at defined times for fate mapping.
Permanent Change Required: When you need one time induction with lasting effect.
When to Use Doxycycline Inducible
Transgene Expression Control: Turn reporter, oncogene, or other transgene on or off.
Reversible Studies: Examine effects of gene activation and subsequent silencing.
Dose Response Studies: Tune expression level by adjusting doxycycline concentration.
Combining Tissue and Temporal Control
Tissue Specific Inducible Cre
Approach: Tissue specific promoter drives CreERT2 expression. CreERT2 present only in target tissue but requires tamoxifen for activity.

Double Specificity: Gene deleted only in specific tissue AND only after tamoxifen. Maximum experimental control.
Intersectional Strategies
Dual Recombinase Systems: Combine Cre/lox with FLP/FRT or Dre/rox for more refined control.
Example: One recombinase defines tissue; second defines timing. Gene deleted only in cells expressing both recombinases.
Experimental Considerations
Induction Timing
Developmental Windows: Induction at different ages produces different phenotypes. Early versus late deletion may reveal distinct functions.
Disease Model Timing: Induce deletion before, during, or after disease onset to model prevention versus treatment.
Pregnancy Considerations: Tamoxifen is teratogenic. Cannot induce during pregnancy without affecting embryos.
Recombination Efficiency
Incomplete Recombination: Not all target cells may undergo recombination, especially with lower tamoxifen doses or shorter regimens.
Monitoring Recombination: Include reporter allele (Rosa26 tdTomato) to visualize which cells recombined.
Dose Optimization: Higher tamoxifen doses increase recombination efficiency but also increase side effects.
Background Activity
Leaky Expression: Some CreERT2 lines show low level recombination without tamoxifen (leakiness).
Controls: Always include uninduced Cre positive controls to assess background recombination.
Line Selection: Some CreERT2 variants (improved ERT2) show reduced leakiness.

What Researchers Say
“iTL produced four conditional knockout mouse models on our behalf. They have been extremely helpful and informative at all stages of the project; all the way from construct design to breeding strategies and genotyping the new mouse models. I know where to turn when the need comes up again for another mouse project; it is certainly faster and cheaper than doing this by ourselves.”

Frequently Asked Questions
What is the difference between tamoxifen-inducible (CreER) and doxycycline-inducible (Tet) systems?
Tamoxifen-inducible Cre (CreER) enables permanent genetic changes (gene deletion via loxP recombination) with temporal control. Doxycycline-inducible (Tet) enables reversible transgene expression control. CreER provides permanent effects after induction; Tet provides reversible on/off control for expression studies.
When should I use tamoxifen-inducible vs doxycycline-inducible?
Use tamoxifen-inducible for conditional gene knockout studies, lineage tracing, or when permanent changes are needed. Use doxycycline-inducible for transgene expression control, reversible studies, or dose-response experiments. Selection depends on whether you need permanent genetic modification or reversible expression control.
How do you combine tissue-specific and temporal control?
Use tissue-specific promoters to drive inducible systems (e.g., Albumin-CreER for liver-specific inducible knockout, or Albumin-rtTA for liver-specific doxycycline control). This provides both spatial control (tissue-specific) and temporal control (drug-inducible), enabling maximum experimental precision.
What are the dosing requirements for inducible systems?
Tamoxifen is typically administered via IP injection (75-100 mg/kg for 3-5 days), oral gavage (100-200 mg/kg), or diet (400 mg/kg chow). Doxycycline is administered in drinking water (1-2 mg/mL) or diet (200-2000 mg/kg). Dosing depends on efficiency requirements, duration, and route preference.
