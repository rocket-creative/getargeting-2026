Rare Disease Mouse Models
Since 1998, Ingenious Targeting Laboratory has supported rare disease researchers with custom mouse models for studying disease mechanisms and developing therapeutics. Our rare disease models have contributed to research on lysosomal storage disorders, metabolic diseases, neurodegenerative conditions, and hundreds of other genetic diseases, with results published in peer reviewed journals and supporting therapeutic development for underserved patient populations.
Rare disease mouse models enable researchers to understand how specific genetic mutations cause disease, identify therapeutic targets, and test potential treatments. With over 7,000 rare diseases affecting an estimated 300 million people worldwide, mouse models provide essential platforms for developing therapies for conditions that have historically lacked treatment options.
From patient specific mutation knockins to complete gene replacement models, Ingenious Targeting Laboratory designs rare disease models tailored to your specific research questions and therapeutic development goals.
Modeling Rare Genetic Diseases
Patient Mutation Knockins
The most translationally relevant rare disease models express the exact mutations found in patients:
	•	Point mutations:** Single nucleotide changes causing missense, nonsense, or splice site alterations
	•	Small insertions/deletions:** Frameshift or in frame modifications
	•	Repeat expansions:** Trinucleotide or other repeat disorders
	•	Regulatory mutations:** Changes affecting gene expression
Patient mutation knockins express variants at physiological levels from the endogenous locus, accurately modeling disease pathophysiology.

Gene Knockout Models
Complete loss of function models represent severe disease alleles:
	•	Null alleles:** Complete absence of gene product
	•	Conditional knockouts:** Enable tissue specific or temporal gene deletion
	•	Hypomorphic alleles:** Reduced but not absent gene function
(/knockout-mouse-models)
Humanized Disease Models
Human gene replacement enables study of human specific disease biology:
	•	Complete human gene replacement for species specific pathology
	•	Humanized targets for gene therapy or antisense oligonucleotide testing
	•	Human specific splice variants for exon skipping approaches

Applications in Therapeutic Development
Gene Therapy Testing
Rare disease models provide platforms for gene therapy evaluation:
	•	AAV mediated gene replacement efficacy
	•	Dose response and biodistribution studies
	•	Long term expression durability
	•	Safety and immunogenicity assessment
Antisense Oligonucleotide Development
Models support ASO and siRNA therapeutic development:
	•	Humanized target sequences for human specific ASOs
	•	Splice modulation efficacy testing
	•	Gene knockdown approaches
	•	Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies
Enzyme Replacement Therapy
Enzyme deficient models enable ERT evaluation:
	•	Efficacy of recombinant enzyme administration
	•	Tissue distribution and uptake
	•	Substrate reduction assessment
	•	Dosing regimen optimization
Small Molecule Development
Models support small molecule therapeutic approaches:
	•	Pharmacological chaperone efficacy
	•	Substrate reduction therapy
	•	Read through compounds for nonsense mutations
	•	Enzyme activators or stabilizers
Technical Considerations
Phenotype Considerations
Rare disease models may show variable phenotype penetrance:
	•	Mouse phenotype may differ from human disease presentation
	•	Age of onset may be compressed or extended compared to patients
	•	Severity may vary between mouse strains
	•	Some human symptoms may not manifest in mice
Our scientific team advises on expected phenotypes and appropriate endpoints for each disease.
Strain Background Selection
Strain background can significantly modify rare disease phenotypes:
	•	C57BL/6:** Most common, extensive baseline data
	•	Mixed backgrounds:** May be required for viability of severe mutations
	•	Modifier genes:** Different strains carry different genetic modifiers
(/c57bl6-mouse-background)
Conditional Approaches for Severe Mutations
Mutations causing early lethality may require conditional expression:
	•	Tissue specific disease modeling with Cre lox
	•	Inducible systems for adult onset disease induction
	•	Hypomorphic alleles for partial loss of function
(/conditional-knockout-mouse-models)
Working with Patient Advocacy Groups
Rare disease research often involves collaboration with patient foundations and advocacy groups:
	•	Foundation funded model generation
	•	Shared resource development for research community
	•	Natural history study support
	•	Therapeutic development partnerships
Ingenious Targeting Laboratory has experience working with patient foundations and can structure projects to meet foundation requirements.

Frequently Asked Questions
What types of rare disease models can be generated?
Rare disease models include point mutation knockins modeling specific patient variants, knockout models for loss-of-function diseases, conditional models for tissue-specific studies, and humanized models for testing human-specific therapeutics. Selection depends on disease mechanism, mutation type, and therapeutic strategy.
How do you model specific patient mutations in rare diseases?
Patient mutations are modeled through point mutation knockin, where the exact patient variant is introduced into the mouse gene. Pre-germline characterization includes sequence verification to confirm exact mutation incorporation, ensuring mice carry precisely the intended disease allele before mouse generation.
Can rare disease models be used for gene therapy testing?
Yes. Rare disease models are extensively used for testing gene therapy approaches including AAV-mediated gene replacement, antisense oligonucleotide development, enzyme replacement therapy evaluation, and small molecule therapeutic development. Models enable evaluation of therapeutic efficacy, safety, and long-term persistence.
How do rare disease model phenotypes compare to human disease?
Mouse phenotypes may differ from human disease presentation in severity, age of onset, or specific symptoms. However, models capture core disease mechanisms and enable therapeutic testing. Phenotype validation includes comparison to human disease characteristics and assessment of therapeutic response.
