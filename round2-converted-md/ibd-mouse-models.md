IBD Mouse Models
Since 1998, ingenious targeting laboratory has supported inflammatory bowel disease research with custom mouse models enabling mechanistic studies of intestinal inflammation, mucosal immunity, and therapeutic interventions for Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis.
IBD mouse models provide essential platforms for investigating the molecular pathways underlying chronic intestinal inflammation, testing hypotheses about epithelial barrier function and immune dysregulation, and developing therapies for millions of patients affected by these debilitating conditions.
Understanding Inflammatory Bowel Disease
Inflammatory bowel disease encompasses chronic inflammatory conditions of the gastrointestinal tract, primarily Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis. Mouse models enable controlled study of disease mechanisms in the complex intestinal environment.
Crohn Disease
Distribution
Can affect any part of the GI tract from mouth to anus, most commonly the terminal ileum and colon. Transmural inflammation with skip lesions.
Pathology
Granulomatous inflammation, strictures, fistulae, and abscesses.
Genetics
Associations with NOD2, ATG16L1, IRGM, IL23R, and many other genes affecting innate immunity, autophagy, and barrier function.
Ulcerative Colitis
Distribution
Limited to the colon and rectum. Continuous inflammation extending proximally from rectum.
Pathology
Mucosal and submucosal inflammation with crypt abscesses and pseudopolyps.
Genetics
Associations with HLA genes, IL10, IL23R, and genes affecting epithelial barrier function.
Spontaneous IBD Models
Genetic Models
Gene targeted mice that develop spontaneous intestinal inflammation:
IL10 Knockout
Develops spontaneous colitis dependent on intestinal microbiota. Widely used model showing importance of regulatory cytokines.
IL2 Knockout
Autoimmune colitis with ulcerative colitis like features.
TCR Alpha Knockout
Develops colitis due to lack of regulatory T cells.
Gai2 Knockout
Develops ulcerative colitis like disease.
NOD2 Models
Crohn disease associated gene:
NOD2 Knockout
Impaired innate immune responses to bacteria. May require additional triggers for colitis development.
NOD2 Knockin
Patient derived variants (R702W, G908R, L1007fs) model Crohn susceptibility.
Autophagy Gene Models
ATG16L1 Hypomorph
Reduced ATG16L1 causes Paneth cell abnormalities resembling Crohn disease.
IRGM Knockout
Impaired autophagy of intracellular bacteria.
Induced Colitis Models
Chemical Induction
DSS (Dextran Sulfate Sodium)
Oral DSS damages epithelial barrier, causing acute colitis. Cycles of DSS produce chronic colitis. Simple, reproducible model.
TNBS (Trinitrobenzene Sulfonic Acid)
Rectal administration of TNBS in ethanol causes transmural inflammation resembling Crohn disease.
Oxazolone
Produces Th2 mediated colitis resembling ulcerative colitis.
T Cell Transfer Model
CD45RBhigh T Cell Transfer
Transfer of naive CD4+ T cells into immunodeficient recipients causes chronic colitis. Models T cell mediated inflammation.
Regulatory T Cell Suppression
Co transfer of Tregs prevents disease, demonstrating regulatory mechanisms.
Infectious Models
Citrobacter rodentium
Attaching/effacing bacterial pathogen causes colitis. Models infectious triggers of IBD.
Helicobacter hepaticus
In combination with immune deficiency, causes chronic colitis.
Barrier Function Models
Epithelial Genes
Villin Cre Specific Knockouts
Intestinal epithelium specific deletion of genes affecting barrier function.
Claudin Knockouts
Tight junction protein deficiency increases intestinal permeability.
MUC2 Knockout
Mucin deficiency exposes epithelium to bacteria, causing spontaneous colitis.
Paneth Cell Function
ATG16L1 Hypomorph
Paneth cell granule abnormalities.
XBP1 Conditional Knockout
ER stress in intestinal epithelium causes inflammation.
Model Design Considerations
Microbiota Dependence
Many IBD models require intestinal bacteria:
Germ Free Conditions
IL10 knockout and other models do not develop colitis when germ free.
Specific Pathogen Free
Standard housing conditions allow disease development.
Defined Microbiota
Gnotobiotic approaches enable controlled microbiome studies.
Background Strain Effects
IBD phenotypes vary dramatically with genetic background:
C57BL/6
Th1 biased responses. Standard background for many models.
BALB/c
Th2 biased responses. Different disease characteristics.
129 Strains
Some models more or less severe depending on background.

Conditional Approaches
Distinguish cell type specific contributions:
Epithelial
Villin Cre targets intestinal epithelium.
Myeloid
LysM Cre targets macrophages and neutrophils.
T Cell
CD4 Cre targets T lymphocytes.
Dendritic Cell
CD11c Cre targets antigen presenting cells.

Phenotyping IBD Models
Clinical Assessment
Body Weight
Weight loss is primary indicator of disease severity.
Stool Consistency
Diarrhea scoring (formed, loose, liquid).
Occult Blood
Hemoccult testing for GI bleeding.
Disease Activity Index
Combined scoring of weight, stool, and bleeding.
Histological Assessment
H&E Staining
Inflammation, crypt damage, ulceration, and architectural distortion.
Histological Scoring
Standardized scoring systems quantify pathology.
Immunohistochemistry
Immune cell infiltration, cytokine expression.
Endoscopic Assessment
Colonoscopy
In vivo visualization of mucosal inflammation.
Mucosal Scoring
Quantify inflammation, bleeding, and ulceration.
Molecular Endpoints
Cytokine Expression
qPCR or ELISA for inflammatory cytokines (TNF, IL1B, IL6, IL17, IL23).
Barrier Function
FITC dextran permeability assay.
Microbiome Analysis
16S sequencing of intestinal bacteria.
Therapeutic Applications
Anti Inflammatory Biologics
Anti TNF

ITL's Approach to IBD Models
Pre Germline Characterization
ES cell based targeting provides comprehensive verification:
Sequence Verification
Ensures precise allele design.
Complex IBD Model Design
IBD research benefits from sophisticated genetic tools:
Cell Type Specific
Conditional alleles for epithelial, immune, or stromal cell studies.
Patient Variant Knockins
Model specific Crohn or UC susceptibility variants.
Reporter Integration
Track inflammatory responses or specific cell populations.
What Researchers Say
“I’ve been working with iTL over the past 5 years in the production of 3 different genetically altered mice. Not only did iTL help in the design of the mice, but the entire process was transparent with the opportunity at any time along the way to discuss my questions or concerns with scientists who had significant insight into the process. The mice were delivered on time, as billed!”

Frequently Asked Questions
What Cre drivers are used for IBD studies?
Common IBD Cre drivers include Villin-Cre (intestinal epithelium), LysM-Cre (macrophages and neutrophils), CD4-Cre (T lymphocytes), CD11c-Cre (dendritic cells), and CX3CR1-Cre (monocytes/macrophages). Selection depends on whether you're studying epithelial barrier function, immune cell contributions, or combined mechanisms.
How do genetic backgrounds affect IBD model phenotypes?
IBD phenotypes vary dramatically with genetic background. C57BL/6 shows Th1-biased responses and is standard for many models. BALB/c shows Th2-biased responses with different disease characteristics. Some models show more or less severe phenotypes depending on background. Consistent background use within studies is critical.
Can IBD models be combined with microbiome manipulation?
Yes. IBD models can be combined with gnotobiotic approaches (germ-free or specific pathogen-free conditions) to control microbiome composition. DSS or TNBS models can be used in gnotobiotic mice to study specific microbial contributions. Antibiotic treatment can also modify microbiome in IBD models.
How do you phenotype IBD mouse models?
IBD phenotyping includes clinical assessment (body weight, stool consistency, occult blood, disease activity index), histological analysis (H&E staining, inflammation scoring, crypt damage, architectural distortion), endoscopic assessment (in vivo visualization, mucosal scoring), and molecular endpoints (cytokine expression, barrier function assays).
