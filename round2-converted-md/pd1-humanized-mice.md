PD1 Humanized Mouse
Since 1998, Ingenious Targeting Laboratory has supported immuno oncology researchers with custom humanized mouse models for checkpoint immunotherapy development. Our PD1 humanized mice enable direct testing of anti human PD1 therapeutic antibodies in immunocompetent mouse systems, supporting preclinical evaluation of clinical candidates.
PD1 (programmed cell death protein 1, encoded by PDCD1) is a key immune checkpoint receptor expressed on activated T cells. Therapeutic antibodies targeting PD1 have transformed cancer treatment, with pembrolizumab, nivolumab, and other anti PD1 agents approved across multiple tumor types. Because these antibodies are designed specifically for human PD1 and show limited cross reactivity with mouse PD1, humanized models are essential for preclinical efficacy testing.
Ingenious Targeting Laboratory generates custom PD1 humanized mice tailored to your specific research requirements, from extracellular domain humanization for antibody testing to complete gene replacement for comprehensive human PD1 biology studies.
Why Humanize PD1
Species Specificity of Therapeutic Antibodies
Anti PD1 therapeutic antibodies are engineered specifically for human PD1:
	•	Antibody epitopes designed against human PD1 sequence
	•	Limited or no binding to mouse PD1 ortholog
	•	Cannot evaluate efficacy in wildtype mice
	•	Surrogate antibodies against mouse PD1 may not predict human responses
Humanized PD1 mice express the human target, enabling direct testing of clinical antibody candidates.
Maintaining Immunocompetent System
PD1 humanization preserves the mouse immune system:
	•	Functional T cells expressing human PD1
	•	Intact tumor microenvironment interactions
	•	Normal immune cell development and function
	•	Physiological PD1/PDL1 axis signaling
Unlike xenograft models in immunodeficient mice, humanized checkpoint models enable immunotherapy studies in animals with functional adaptive immunity.
Translational Relevance
Humanized models improve translation to clinical outcomes:
	•	Test the actual clinical candidate, not a surrogate
	•	Evaluate on target effects with human protein engagement
	•	Develop and validate human specific biomarkers
	•	Support regulatory submissions with relevant efficacy data
Humanization Strategies
Extracellular Domain Humanization
The most common approach replaces the mouse PD1 extracellular domain with human sequence while retaining mouse intracellular signaling domains:
	•	Human extracellular domain provides antibody binding epitopes
	•	Mouse transmembrane and intracellular domains preserved
	•	Normal signaling through mouse downstream pathways
	•	Maintained compatibility with mouse immune system
This strategy is optimal for therapeutic antibody testing where the goal is to evaluate antibody binding and blocking activity.
Complete Gene Humanization
Full replacement of mouse Pdcd1 with human PDCD1:
	•	Complete human PD1 protein sequence
	•	Human specific signaling characteristics
	•	Study human PD1 biology comprehensively
	•	May require consideration of species specific interactions
Conditional Humanization
Conditional approaches enable controlled humanization:
	•	Tissue specific humanization using Cre lox
	•	Inducible humanization for temporal control
	•	Compare humanized and mouse PD1 in same animal
Applications
Anti PD1 Antibody Efficacy Testing
Primary application for PD1 humanized mice:
	•	Test pembrolizumab, nivolumab, and other clinical antibodies
	•	Evaluate novel anti PD1 candidates
	•	Compare antibody potency and characteristics
	•	Assess Fc effector function contributions
Combination Immunotherapy
PD1 humanized mice support combination studies:
	•	Anti PD1 plus chemotherapy
	•	Anti PD1 plus radiation
	•	Anti PD1 plus targeted therapy
	•	Anti PD1 plus other checkpoint inhibitors (dual humanized models)

PD1 + CTLA4
Ipilimumab + nivolumab combinations
PD1 + LAG3
Next generation checkpoint combinations
PD1 + TIM3
Emerging combination strategies

Triple and Multi Checkpoint Models
For complex combination studies, multiple checkpoint humanizations can be combined through breeding or sequential targeting. Our scientific team advises on efficient strategies for generating multi humanized models.
Technical Considerations
Pre Germline Characterization
ES cell based targeting enables comprehensive characterization of PD1 humanized alleles before mouse generation:
	•	Sequence verification confirms exact human sequence integration
	•	Junction analysis verifies mouse to human transitions
	•	Expression testing confirms human PD1 protein in ES cells
	•	Antibody binding can be tested in ES cells where applicable
Pre germline characterization ensures that humanized mice express functional human PD1 that engages therapeutic antibodies as intended.
Strain Background
Choose strain background based on tumor model compatibility:
	•	C57BL/6:** Compatible with MC38, B16, LLC, E0771
	•	BALB/c:** Compatible with CT26, 4T1, EMT6
Our scientific team advises on optimal strain background for your research program.

	•	Confirm human PD1 surface expression on T cells
	•	Verify therapeutic antibody binding
	•	Test functional checkpoint blockade
	•	Compare to wildtype controls

What Researchers Say
“iTL produced four conditional knockout mouse models on our behalf. They have been extremely helpful and informative at all stages of the project; all the way from construct design to breeding strategies and genotyping the new mouse models. I know where to turn when the need comes up again for another mouse project; it is certainly faster and cheaper than doing this by ourselves.”
– **William A. Coetzee, DSc NYU School of Medicine

"The quality of service was exceptional and performed to the highest possible standards."

Frequently Asked Questions
What is the difference between full humanization and ECD-only humanization for PD1?
Full humanization replaces the entire mouse PD1 gene with human PD1 sequence. ECD-only humanization replaces only the extracellular domain while retaining mouse transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. Full humanization is preferred for antibody testing; ECD-only may preserve some mouse signaling functions.
Can PD1 humanized mice be combined with other checkpoint humanizations?
Yes. PD1 humanization can be combined with PDL1, CTLA4, LAG3, TIM3, or other checkpoint humanizations to create double, triple, or multi-checkpoint models. Common combinations include PD1+CTLA4 and PD1+LAG3 for combination checkpoint blockade studies.
Can PD1 humanized mice be used with syngeneic tumor models?
Yes. PD1 humanized mice on C57BL/6 background are compatible with syngeneic tumor models (MC38, B16, LLC, E0771) to create systems where both tumor and immune compartments express human targets. This enables evaluation of checkpoint blockade in immunocompetent animals with intact tumor immunity.
