Gene Targeting Technology Overview
Since 1998, Ingenious Targeting Laboratory has advanced gene targeting technologies through more than 2,500 custom mouse model projects. Our technology platform combines proven ES cell gene targeting with sophisticated conditional systems, inducible expression controls, and proprietary innovations to deliver mouse models with verified genetic modifications.
Understanding these technologies helps researchers design optimal targeting strategies and interpret model capabilities. This overview introduces the core technologies that enable precise genetic modification in mice, from basic gene targeting through advanced conditional and inducible systems.
Core Gene Targeting Technologies
ES Cell Gene Targeting
ES cell gene targeting is a strong methodology for precise genetic modification. Ingenious Targeting Laboratory's ES cell methodology provides pre germline characterization, ensuring correct allele structure before mouse generation.
	•	Pre germline verification through PCR and RT-PCR
	•	Defined starting point with characterized ES cell clones
	•	Predictable inheritance patterns
	•	Archived ES cells for future derivative allele generation
(/es-cell-gene-targeting)
Homologous Recombination
Homologous recombination enables precise genetic modification by exchanging sequences between targeting vectors and chromosomal DNA, ensuring targeted modifications occur at the intended locus with surrounding genomic architecture intact.
Conditional Gene Targeting Systems
Cre Lox System
The Cre lox recombination system enables conditional gene modification by placing critical exons between loxP recognition sites. Cre recombinase expression, driven by tissue specific or inducible promoters, catalyzes recombination to delete flanked sequences.
	•	Tissue specific gene deletion through Cre driver lines
	•	Temporal control via inducible Cre systems
	•	Flexible allele design with multiple derivative options
	•	Widely used and well characterized system
(/cre-lox-system)
FLP FRT System
The FLP FRT system provides an orthogonal recombination approach that works independently or in combination with Cre lox, primarily used for selection cassette removal and complex multi recombinase strategies.
(/flp-frt-system)
Dre Rox System
Dre Rox provides a third orthogonal recombinase system, enabling sophisticated intersectional strategies where gene modification requires expression of multiple recombinases.
Inducible Expression Systems
Tamoxifen Inducible (CreERT2)
Tamoxifen inducible systems provide temporal control over gene deletion. CreERT2 fusion proteins remain inactive until tamoxifen administration, enabling gene deletion at defined timepoints.
	•	Permanent genetic change after single administration
	•	Wide variety of tissue specific CreERT2 lines available
	•	Well characterized and reliable system
	•	Enables adult deletion of developmentally essential genes

F.A.S.T.™ Technology
F.A.S.T.™ (Flexible Accelerated STOP Tetracycline Operator) provides versatile inducible/reversible control enabling multiple expression modes from a single knockin allele, including knockout first, inducible expression, and conditional knockdown modes.

Proprietary Technologies
Rapid Rosa26™ Targeting
Ingenious Targeting Laboratory's Rapid Rosa26™ technology accelerates transgenic model generation through established protocols and proven vector backbones, enabling shorter timelines with reliable, high quality models.
(/rapid-rosa26-targeting)
TruView Conditional Knockout™
TruView Conditional Knockout™ technology guarantees strong reporter expression after knockout, enabling reliable visualization of recombined cells regardless of target gene expression levels. This proprietary approach works with genes of almost any size.
TruHumanization™
TruHumanization™ technology optimizes humanization strategies by analyzing human mouse protein homology, functional domain conservation, and therapeutic target requirements to recommend optimal humanization approaches.
Advanced Targeting Strategies
Derivative Allele System
The derivative allele system enables generation of multiple model types from a single targeted ES cell clone, including knockout first, null, conditional ready, and conditional null alleles.
(/derivative-alleles)
Large Scale Targeting (BAC to BAC)
BAC to BAC technology enables targeting of large genomic regions up to 200kb, breaking free from size constraints to enable complex humanization and multi gene targeting projects.
(/bac-to-bac-large-scale-targeting)
Safe Harbor Locus Targeting
Safe harbor loci including Rosa26, HPRT, and H11 provide predictable transgene integration sites with stable expression and minimal positional effects.

What Researchers Say
“I’ve been working with iTL over the past 5 years in the production of 3 different genetically altered mice. Not only did iTL help in the design of the mice, but the entire process was transparent with the opportunity at any time along the way to discuss my questions or concerns with scientists who had significant insight into the process. The mice were delivered on time, as billed!”

Frequently Asked Questions
How do conditional systems (Cre-lox, FLP-FRT, Dre-Rox) differ?
Cre-lox is the primary system for conditional gene deletion, with extensive driver line availability. FLP-FRT is primarily used for selection cassette removal and complementing Cre-lox in dual recombinase strategies. Dre-Rox provides a third orthogonal system for sophisticated intersectional strategies. Selection depends on whether you need gene deletion, cassette removal, or independent control of multiple modifications.
What is safe-harbor targeting and why is it used?
Safe-harbor targeting inserts transgenes at defined genomic locations (Rosa26, H11, HPRT) that support transgene integration without disrupting endogenous genes or causing position effects. This provides single-copy integration, predictable expression patterns, and reproducible results across founder lines, unlike random integration.
