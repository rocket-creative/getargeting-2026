Diabetes Mouse Models
Since 1998, Ingenious Targeting Laboratory has supported diabetes researchers with custom mouse models contributing to peer reviewed publications in Diabetes, Cell Metabolism, Diabetologia, and leading metabolism journals worldwide. Our diabetes mouse models have advanced understanding of beta cell biology, insulin signaling, and the pathophysiology of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes.
Diabetes mouse models enable researchers to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying glucose homeostasis, insulin secretion, and insulin action. From beta cell specific knockouts that isolate islet function to tissue specific deletions in liver, muscle, and adipose tissue that dissect peripheral insulin resistance, the right model design is critical for understanding disease biology and developing effective therapeutics.
Conditional approaches are essential in diabetes research, where the same gene often has distinct metabolic functions in different tissues. Ingenious Targeting Laboratory designs and generates custom diabetes models tailored to your specific research questions.
Type 1 Diabetes Models
Modeling Autoimmune Beta Cell Destruction
Type 1 diabetes results from autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells. Mouse models address both the immune and beta cell components of disease:
	•	NOD background models:** The NOD mouse spontaneously develops autoimmune diabetes; genetic modifications on this background enable study of specific immune pathways
	•	Immune gene knockouts:** Deletions affecting T cell, B cell, or innate immune function reveal mechanisms of autoimmune pathogenesis
	•	Beta cell specific deletions:** Conditional knockouts in beta cells identify genes essential for cell survival under immune attack
	•	Antigen presentation models:** Modifications affecting MHC or antigen processing alter diabetes susceptibility

Type 2 Diabetes Models
Modeling Insulin Resistance and Beta Cell Dysfunction
Type 2 diabetes involves both peripheral insulin resistance and eventual beta cell failure. Mouse models address these interconnected pathologies:
	•	Tissue specific insulin signaling knockouts:** Deletions in liver, muscle, or adipose tissue reveal tissue specific contributions to glucose homeostasis
	•	Beta cell function models:** Knockouts affecting insulin secretion, beta cell mass, or glucose sensing
	•	Diet induced models:** Genetic susceptibility combined with high fat diet challenge
	•	Lipid metabolism models:** Modifications affecting fatty acid handling and lipotoxicity
Tissue Specific Approaches
Conditional knockouts enable dissection of gene function in specific metabolic tissues:
Cre Driver
Target Tissue
Metabolic Function
Albumin Cre
Hepatocytes
Gluconeogenesis, lipid metabolism
Adiponectin Cre
Adipocytes
Lipid storage, adipokine secretion
Insulin Cre / Pdx1 Cre
Beta cells
Insulin secretion, beta cell mass
MCK Cre / MyoD Cre
Skeletal muscle
Glucose uptake, insulin sensitivity
Nestin Cre
Hypothalamus
Central metabolic regulation
Villin Cre
Intestinal epithelium
Incretin signaling, nutrient absorption
A single floxed allele can be crossed to multiple Cre drivers to study gene function across metabolic tissues, maximizing the utility of your model investment.

Model Types for Diabetes Research
Conditional Knockout Models
Conditional knockouts are essential in diabetes research because many metabolic genes have distinct functions in different tissues:
	•	Beta cell specific knockouts:** Study insulin secretion without confounding peripheral effects
	•	Hepatocyte specific knockouts:** Isolate hepatic glucose production from other metabolic tissues
	•	Adipose specific knockouts:** Investigate adipokine signaling and lipid storage
	•	Inducible knockouts:** Delete genes in adult animals to bypass developmental compensation
(/conditional-knockout-mouse-models)
Knockin Models
Knockin models enable precise modifications for diabetes research:
	•	Disease mutation knockins:** Express MODY mutations or other diabetes associated variants at physiological levels
	•	Reporter knockins:** Track beta cell mass, insulin expression, or metabolic pathway activation
	•	Humanized receptors:** Enable testing of human specific therapeutics (insulin analogs, GLP1 agonists)
(/knockin-mouse-models)
Humanized Models
Humanization enables testing of human specific therapeutics and study of human specific biology:
	•	Humanized drug targets for antibody or peptide therapeutic testing
	•	Humanized metabolic enzymes for pharmacokinetic studies
	•	Humanized receptors for species specific ligand interactions

Technical Considerations
Strain Background Considerations
Strain background significantly impacts metabolic phenotypes:
Strain
Metabolic Characteristics
Considerations
C57BL/6J
Nnt mutation impairs insulin secretion; susceptible to diet induced obesity
Document Nnt status; consider for obesity studies
C57BL/6N
Intact Nnt; more robust insulin secretion
Preferred for beta cell function studies
NOD
Spontaneous autoimmune diabetes
Required background for T1D studies
BALB/c
Relatively resistant to diet induced obesity
Less commonly used for metabolic studies
The Nnt mutation in C57BL/6J should be considered when studying beta cell function or insulin secretion. C57BL/6N may be preferred for studies where intact insulin secretion is important.

Derivative Allele Flexibility
The derivative allele system provides maximum flexibility for diabetes research programs:
	•	tm1a:** Reporter allele for expression pattern analysis in metabolic tissues
	•	tm1b:** Null allele for global knockout studies
	•	tm1c:** Conditional allele for tissue specific deletion
	•	tm1d:** Conditional null after Cre mediated excision
A single project generates alleles suitable for global knockout studies, tissue specific conditional knockouts across multiple metabolic organs, and reporter analysis of gene expression patterns.

Frequently Asked Questions
What is the difference between type 1 and type 2 diabetes mouse models?
Type 1 diabetes models involve beta cell destruction or dysfunction (e.g., beta cell-specific knockouts, autoimmune models). Type 2 diabetes models involve insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction (e.g., insulin signaling knockouts, obesity models). Both can be generated using conditional knockout approaches.
Which metabolic tissues should I target for diabetes research?
Common targets include beta cells (Insulin-Cre), liver (Albumin-Cre), muscle (MCK-Cre), adipose tissue (Adiponectin-Cre), and hypothalamus (Nestin-Cre). Tissue selection depends on whether you're studying insulin secretion, insulin action, or central metabolic control.
What phenotyping assays are typically performed on diabetes models?
Standard assays include glucose tolerance testing (GTT), insulin tolerance testing (ITT), fasting glucose and insulin, body composition analysis, and indirect calorimetry. More advanced studies include hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps and islet perifusion studies.
Can I combine multiple metabolic gene modifications in one model?
Yes. Multiple alleles can be combined through breeding to study gene interactions in metabolic pathways. For example, combining beta cell knockouts with insulin signaling knockouts enables study of how insulin secretion and action interact to control glucose homeostasis.
How long does it take to see metabolic phenotypes in diabetes models?
Phenotype timing depends on the gene and model type. Some models show glucose intolerance within weeks of gene deletion (inducible systems). Others require months of aging or high-fat diet challenge. Beta cell-specific knockouts may develop diabetes more rapidly than insulin resistance models.
