LAG3 Humanized Mouse Models
Since 1998, ingenious targeting laboratory has supported immuno oncology research with humanized immune checkpoint models including LAG3 humanized mice that enable direct preclinical evaluation of clinical anti LAG3 antibody candidates and combination checkpoint blockade strategies.
LAG3 humanized mice express human LAG3 protein on T cells and other lymphocyte populations, enabling testing of human specific therapeutic antibodies in immunocompetent animals with intact tumor immunity. These models are essential for evaluating relatlimab class anti LAG3 antibodies and next generation combination therapies.
LAG3 in Cancer Immunotherapy
Lymphocyte activation gene 3 (LAG3) is an emerging immune checkpoint target with the first anti LAG3 antibody (relatlimab) receiving FDA approval in 2022 in combination with nivolumab for melanoma treatment.
LAG3 Biology
LAG3 is a CD4 homolog expressed on activated T cells, regulatory T cells, NK cells, and other lymphocyte populations:
MHC Class II Binding
LAG3 binds MHC class II molecules with higher affinity than CD4. This interaction delivers inhibitory signals to T cells and may sequester MHC II from CD4 engagement.
Alternative Ligands
LAG3 also binds fibrinogen like protein 1 (FGL1), galectin 3, and LSECtin, expanding its regulatory functions beyond MHC II interaction.
T Cell Exhaustion
LAG3 is a marker of T cell exhaustion in chronic viral infection and cancer. LAG3 positive T cells show reduced effector function and proliferative capacity.
Regulatory T Cell Function
LAG3 contributes to regulatory T cell mediated suppression. LAG3 blockade may reduce Treg suppressive activity in the tumor microenvironment.
Clinical Anti LAG3 Antibodies
Relatlimab
The first FDA approved anti LAG3 antibody, approved in combination with nivolumab for unresectable or metastatic melanoma. Relatlimab is a human IgG4 antibody.
Additional Clinical Candidates
Multiple anti LAG3 antibodies are in clinical development, including fianlimab, favezelimab, and others, as monotherapy and in combinations.
Bispecific Approaches
Bispecific antibodies targeting both LAG3 and PD1 are in clinical development, offering single molecule combination checkpoint blockade.
Species Specificity Challenge
Clinical anti LAG3 antibodies are designed for human LAG3 and do not cross react with mouse Lag3:
Limited Surrogate Data
Anti mouse Lag3 antibodies provide mechanistic insights but may not predict clinical antibody behavior.
Humanized Model Requirement
Human LAG3 expression in mice enables direct testing of clinical candidates in a relevant in vivo setting.
LAG3 Humanization Strategies
Complete Gene Replacement
Full replacement of mouse Lag3 with human LAG3 coding sequences:
Endogenous Regulatory Control
Human LAG3 expressed from the native mouse promoter maintains physiological expression patterns on appropriate lymphocyte populations.
Functional Preservation
The humanized allele preserves LAG3 function to maintain normal immune regulation.
Extracellular Domain Humanization
Humanization of the extracellular domain provides human epitopes for antibody binding while retaining mouse intracellular signaling domains.
Design Considerations
Signal Peptide
Appropriate signal peptide for efficient surface expression.
Transmembrane and Cytoplasmic Domains
Mouse sequences may be retained to ensure proper signaling in the mouse cellular context.
Expression Validation
Confirm human LAG3 surface expression on activated T cells and other appropriate populations.
Applications of LAG3 Humanized Mice
Monotherapy Evaluation
Testing anti LAG3 antibodies as single agents:
Syngeneic Tumor Models
LAG3 humanized mice combined with syngeneic tumors enable efficacy assessment in immunocompetent animals.
Dose Response
Establish pharmacologically relevant dosing for clinical candidates.
Target Engagement
Measure antibody binding to LAG3 positive cells in tumor and lymphoid tissues.
Combination Checkpoint Blockade
LAG3 is primarily developed in combination with PD1/PDL1 blockade:
LAG3 plus PD1
Dual humanized models expressing both human LAG3 and human PD1 enable testing of relatlimab plus nivolumab class combinations and bispecific antibodies.
LAG3 plus PDL1
Alternative combinations with anti PDL1 antibodies.
Triple Combinations
Multi humanized models for testing LAG3 plus PD1 plus CTLA4 or other three way combinations.

Dual Target Binding
Confirm that bispecific antibodies can engage both targets on the same or different cells.
Bridging Efficacy
Assess whether bispecific format provides advantages over combination of monospecific antibodies.
Multi Checkpoint Humanized Models
Combination checkpoint approaches require models expressing multiple human targets:
Dual Humanized Models
LAG3 plus PD1
Both checkpoints humanized for testing approved combinations and bispecific antibodies.
LAG3 plus PDL1
For anti LAG3 plus anti PDL1 combination studies.
Higher Order Combinations
LAG3 plus PD1 plus CTLA4
Triple humanization for comprehensive checkpoint blockade studies.
LAG3 plus TIM3 plus PD1
Emerging combinations targeting multiple exhaustion markers.
Breeding Considerations
Multi humanized models require complex breeding schemes:
Genetic Linkage
Consider chromosomal location of target genes when planning breeding strategies.
Allele Validation
Confirm each humanized allele functions correctly in the combined genotype.
Colony Efficiency
Plan breeding to efficiently generate experimental cohorts with all required alleles.

What Researchers Say
“iTL produced four conditional knockout mouse models on our behalf. They have been extremely helpful and informative at all stages of the project; all the way from construct design to breeding strategies and genotyping the new mouse models. I know where to turn when the need comes up again for another mouse project; it is certainly faster and cheaper than doing this by ourselves.”
– **William A. Coetzee, DSc** NYU School of Medicine
“I’ve been working with iTL over the past 5 years in the production of 3 different genetically altered mice. Not only did iTL help in the design of the mice, but the entire process was transparent with the opportunity at any time along the way to discuss my questions or concerns with scientists who had significant insight into the process. The mice were delivered on time, as billed!”
— **Raghu Mirmira, MD/Phd**, University of Chicago

Frequently Asked Questions
What is the difference between full humanization and ECD-only humanization for LAG3?
Full humanization replaces the entire mouse LAG3 gene with human LAG3 sequence. ECD-only humanization replaces only the extracellular domain while retaining mouse transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. Full humanization is preferred for antibody testing, while ECD-only may preserve some mouse signaling functions.
Can LAG3 humanized mice be combined with other checkpoint humanizations?
Yes. LAG3 humanization can be combined with PD1, PDL1, CTLA4, TIM3, or other checkpoint humanizations to create double, triple, or multi-checkpoint models. Common combinations include LAG3+PD1 and LAG3+PDL1 for combination checkpoint blockade studies.
Can LAG3 humanized mice be used with syngeneic tumor models?
Yes. LAG3 humanized mice can be combined with syngeneic tumor cell lines (MC38, B16, CT26) to create systems where both tumor and immune compartments express human targets. This enables evaluation of checkpoint blockade in immunocompetent animals with intact tumor immunity, providing more physiologically relevant testing.
