Obesity Mouse Models
Since 1998, ingenious targeting laboratory has supported obesity research with custom mouse models enabling mechanistic studies of energy homeostasis, adipose tissue biology, and metabolic dysfunction underlying the global obesity epidemic.
Obesity mouse models provide essential platforms for investigating the molecular pathways regulating appetite, energy expenditure, and fat storage, as well as developing therapies targeting leptin signaling, hypothalamic circuits, and peripheral metabolic tissues.
The Challenge of Obesity Research
Obesity results from complex interactions between genetic susceptibility, environmental factors, and behavioral patterns. Mouse models enable controlled study of specific genetic contributions to energy balance and metabolic dysfunction.
Genetic vs Environmental Models
Obesity research employs both genetic and dietary approaches:
Genetic Models
Monogenic mutations in leptin, leptin receptor, melanocortin, and other pathways produce severe obesity with defined molecular mechanisms. These models enable study of specific pathways in isolation.
Diet Induced Obesity
High fat diet feeding in susceptible strains (C57BL/6) produces obesity that more closely resembles common human obesity. This approach models gene environment interactions.
Combined Approaches
Genetic modifications on obesogenic backgrounds reveal susceptibility factors and protective mechanisms that modify diet induced obesity.
Major Obesity Genes
Leptin Pathway
Leptin is the prototypical satiety hormone secreted by adipose tissue:
Leptin (ob/ob)
The ob/ob mouse carries a spontaneous mutation in leptin and develops severe obesity due to hyperphagia and reduced energy expenditure. This model established leptin as a key regulator of energy balance.
Leptin Receptor (db/db)
The db/db mouse carries mutations in the leptin receptor, producing leptin resistance and obesity phenotypically similar to ob/ob. This model is also used for diabetes research due to pronounced hyperglycemia.
Leptin Knockin Models
Point mutations affecting leptin secretion or receptor binding enable study of specific aspects of leptin biology.
Melanocortin System
The hypothalamic melanocortin system integrates leptin signals:
MC4R Knockout
Melanocortin 4 receptor knockout produces severe obesity. MC4R mutations are the most common monogenic cause of human obesity.
POMC Knockout
Proopiomelanocortin deficiency eliminates alpha MSH, producing obesity with pigmentation defects.
AgRP Modifications
Agouti related peptide antagonizes melanocortin signaling. AgRP overexpression or targeted manipulations alter feeding behavior and body weight.
Hypothalamic Regulators
Additional hypothalamic circuits control energy balance:
Neuropeptide Y
NPY stimulates feeding. NPY knockout and receptor knockouts reveal contributions to appetite regulation.
SIM1, BDNF, MC3R
Mutations in these genes cause obesity through hypothalamic dysfunction, establishing central nervous system control of energy balance.
Peripheral Metabolic Genes
Genes affecting adipocyte function, lipid metabolism, and insulin signaling:
Adiponectin
Adipokine affecting insulin sensitivity. Knockout and overexpression models reveal metabolic functions.
PPAR Gamma
Master regulator of adipocyte differentiation. Conditional knockouts in specific tissues reveal tissue specific functions.
UCP1
Uncoupling protein 1 mediates thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue. UCP1 knockout reduces energy expenditure.
Model Types for Obesity Research
Genetic Obesity Models
Conventional Knockouts
Global gene deletion reveals overall contribution to energy balance. Essential for genes not required for viability.
Conditional Knockouts
Tissue specific deletion distinguishes central versus peripheral contributions:

	•	Hypothalamic specific**: Nestin Cre, Sim1 Cre, POMC Cre, AgRP Cre
	•	Adipocyte specific**: Adiponectin Cre, Fabp4 Cre
	•	Hepatocyte specific**: Albumin Cre
	•	Muscle specific**: MCK Cre
Inducible Knockouts
Tamoxifen inducible deletion in adults avoids developmental compensation and enables study of gene function in established obesity.
Point Mutation Knockins
Patient derived variants model specific human mutations. Essential for genes where null is lethal or produces different phenotype than hypomorphic mutation.

Diet Induced Obesity Models
C57BL/6 on High Fat Diet
The most common obesity model. C57BL/6 mice are susceptible to diet induced obesity, developing obesity, insulin resistance, and fatty liver on high fat diet (45-60% fat calories).
Genetic Modifications on DIO Background
Knockout or knockin alleles combined with high fat diet reveal gene diet interactions and obesity susceptibility modifiers.
Strain Comparisons
Different inbred strains show varying susceptibility to diet induced obesity. A/J mice are relatively resistant compared to C57BL/6, enabling genetic mapping studies.
Reporter and Tracking Models
Leptin Reporter
Fluorescent reporters in leptin expressing cells enable visualization of adipocyte distribution and dynamics.
Hypothalamic Circuit Reporters
POMC, AgRP, and NPY reporter knockins enable identification and manipulation of specific neuronal populations.
Metabolic Reporters
UCP1 and other metabolic gene reporters track brown adipose activity and thermogenesis.
Model Design Considerations
Background Strain Selection
Obesity phenotypes are profoundly influenced by genetic background:
C57BL/6
Susceptible to diet induced obesity, glucose intolerance, and fatty liver. The preferred background for obesity studies. However, C57BL/6J carries the Nnt mutation affecting glucose metabolism.
C57BL/6J vs C57BL/6N
The J and N substrains differ in metabolic phenotypes. N substrain has intact Nnt and different body composition responses.
DBA/2, 129, BALB/c
Varying susceptibility to diet induced obesity. May be useful for specific experimental designs.

Achieving Robust Obesity Phenotypes
Several factors influence phenotype development:
Diet Composition
High fat diets vary from 45% to 60% fat calories. Higher fat content produces more rapid weight gain. Defined diets are preferable to purified diets for reproducibility.
Duration
Short term feeding (8 to 12 weeks) produces mild obesity and metabolic dysfunction. Long term feeding (16+ weeks) produces severe obesity with pronounced complications.
Age at Initiation
Beginning high fat diet at weaning versus adulthood affects phenotype development and metabolic adaptation.
Housing Conditions
Single housing, thermoneutral conditions, and other environmental factors significantly affect metabolic phenotypes.
Tissue Specific Approaches
Obesity involves multiple organ systems:
Hypothalamic Targeting
Nestin Cre targets neural progenitors broadly. More specific drivers (POMC Cre, AgRP Cre, Sim1 Cre) target defined neuronal populations controlling appetite and energy expenditure.
Adipose Tissue
Adiponectin Cre provides relatively specific adipocyte targeting. Fabp4 Cre also targets endothelial cells and macrophages, which may confound interpretation.
Brown Adipose
UCP1 Cre targets brown adipocytes for thermogenesis studies.
Muscle
MCK Cre and MyoD Cre target skeletal muscle for studies of exercise, glucose uptake, and fatty acid oxidation.
Phenotyping Obesity Models
Body Composition Assessment
Body Weight
Serial weight measurements track obesity development. Weight curves characterize progression.
Body Composition
DEXA or MRI quantifies fat mass, lean mass, and bone density. Echo MRI provides rapid fat and lean mass measurement.
Adipose Depot Analysis
Dissection and weighing of gonadal, inguinal, mesenteric, and brown adipose depots.
Metabolic Assessment
Food Intake
Home cage food consumption monitoring. Meal pattern analysis in specialized cages.
Energy Expenditure
Indirect calorimetry measures oxygen consumption and CO2 production. Metabolic cages enable comprehensive energy balance assessment.
Body Temperature
Core temperature measurement for thermogenesis studies. Cold challenge reveals brown adipose function.
Physical Activity
Wheel running, open field activity, or beam break monitoring.
Glucose and Lipid Metabolism
Glucose Tolerance
IPGTT or OGTT assesses glucose handling. Insulin tolerance tests reveal insulin sensitivity.
Plasma Lipids
Cholesterol, triglycerides, free fatty acids, and lipoprotein profiles.
Tissue Lipids
Hepatic triglyceride content for fatty liver assessment. Muscle lipid for ectopic fat deposition.
Histology
Adipocyte Size
H&E staining with morphometric analysis of adipocyte hypertrophy versus hyperplasia.
Crown Like Structures
Macrophage infiltration around dying adipocytes indicates adipose inflammation.
Hepatic Steatosis
Oil Red O staining quantifies hepatic lipid accumulation.
Complex Obesity Model Design
Obesity research often requires sophisticated genetic systems:
Conditional Deletion in Metabolic Tissues
Floxed alleles combined with tissue specific Cre drivers enable dissection of central versus peripheral contributions.
Inducible Obesity Models
Tamoxifen inducible systems enable gene deletion in adult animals with established metabolic set points.
Reporter Integration
Fluorescent reporters enable lineage tracing and cell population identification in metabolic tissues.

Frequently Asked Questions
What metabolic tissues can be targeted for obesity research?
Common targets include adipose tissue (Adiponectin-Cre for adipocytes), hypothalamus (Nestin-Cre, POMC-Cre, AgRP-Cre for appetite control), liver (Albumin-Cre for glucose and lipid metabolism), and muscle (MCK-Cre for glucose uptake and fatty acid oxidation). Tissue selection depends on your research question.
What diet should I use for diet-induced obesity studies?
High-fat diets typically contain 45-60% fat calories. Higher fat content produces more rapid weight gain. Defined diets are preferable to purified diets for reproducibility. Duration of feeding (8-12 weeks for mild obesity, 16+ weeks for severe obesity) and age at initiation affect phenotype development.
What phenotyping assays are used for obesity models?
Standard assessments include body weight, body composition (DEXA or MRI for fat/lean mass), food intake, energy expenditure (indirect calorimetry), glucose tolerance testing, insulin tolerance testing, plasma lipid profiles, and adipose depot analysis. Histological analysis of adipocyte size and inflammation is also important.
Can I combine genetic modifications with diet-induced obesity?
Yes. Combining tissue-specific gene modifications with high-fat diet challenge enables study of how specific genes affect diet-induced obesity and metabolic dysfunction. For example, adipose-specific knockouts on high-fat diet reveal adipocyte-autonomous effects on systemic metabolism.
What is the difference between brown adipose and white adipose in obesity research?
White adipose stores energy and is associated with obesity and metabolic disease. Brown adipose dissipates energy through thermogenesis. Conditional knockouts in UCP1-Cre expressing brown adipocytes enable study of thermogenic function. Adiponectin-Cre targets white adipocytes for studies of adipocyte function in obesity.
