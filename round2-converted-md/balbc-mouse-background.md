BALB/c Mouse Background
Since 1998, Ingenious Targeting Laboratory has generated custom mouse models on multiple strain backgrounds including BALB/c. Understanding strain specific characteristics is essential for selecting the optimal genetic background for your research. BALB/c mice are particularly valuable for immunological studies, syngeneic tumor models, and research where the strain's unique characteristics provide experimental advantages.
Whether you are generating new knockout or knockin models on BALB/c background or backcrossing existing models onto this strain, Ingenious Targeting Laboratory provides the expertise to deliver well characterized models suited to your research needs.
BALB/c Strain Characteristics
Strain Origin and History
BALB/c is one of the oldest and most widely used inbred mouse strains, developed by Halsey Bagg in 1913 and inbred by George Snell beginning in 1932. The albino (c) designation reflects the tyrosinase mutation that eliminates pigmentation.
BALB/c has been inbred for over 200 generations, making it highly genetically uniform and reproducible across experiments.
Physical Characteristics
BALB/c mice are albino with pink eyes and white fur. They are docile and easy to handle, making them suitable for studies requiring regular manipulation. Adults typically weigh 25 to 30 grams with relatively low body fat compared to C57BL/6.
Reproductive Characteristics
BALB/c females are good mothers with typical litter sizes of 5 to 8 pups. The strain breeds reliably and is compatible with standard breeding protocols for genetically modified mice.
Immunological Characteristics
Th2 Biased Immune Response
BALB/c mice show a tendency toward Th2 type immune responses, characterized by IL4, IL5, and IL13 production. This makes them particularly useful for studying allergic diseases, asthma, and parasitic infections.
In contrast, C57BL/6 mice tend toward Th1 responses. This fundamental difference in immune bias should inform strain selection for immunology research.
Antibody Production
BALB/c mice are widely used for monoclonal antibody production due to their ability to generate strong antibody responses. The strain is the source of myeloma cell lines used in hybridoma technology.
Complement System
BALB/c mice have a functional complement system, making them suitable for studies of complement mediated immunity and inflammation.
Research Applications
Syngeneic Tumor Models
Multiple tumor cell lines are derived from BALB/c background and are compatible for syngeneic transplantation, including CT26 (colon carcinoma), 4T1 (breast carcinoma), RENCA (renal carcinoma), and A20 (lymphoma).
These models enable immunotherapy studies in immunocompetent mice with functional immune systems.
Allergy and Asthma Research
The Th2 bias of BALB/c mice makes them particularly suitable for modeling allergic airway disease, atopic dermatitis, and other allergic conditions.
Infectious Disease
BALB/c mice are commonly used in infectious disease research. Their susceptibility or resistance to various pathogens is well characterized, enabling reproducible infection studies.
Autoimmune Disease
BALB/c mice are susceptible to certain autoimmune phenotypes and are used in models of lupus, arthritis, and other autoimmune conditions, often in combination with genetic modifications.
Gene Targeting on BALB/c Background
Strain Availability
For more complex targeting projects, BALB/c derived ES cells can be used for direct targeting on this background. For simpler project types, direct injection into BALB/c embryos is possible.
Backcrossing Strategy
Models initially generated on other backgrounds can be backcrossed onto BALB/c. Speed congenic approaches using marker assisted selection can accelerate establishment of BALB/c congenic lines.

Background Considerations
When planning gene targeting on BALB/c background, consider the strain's specific characteristics:
Advantages: Th2 immune bias for allergy and parasitology, syngeneic tumor model compatibility, docile temperament, extensive historical data.
Considerations: Some phenotypes may differ from C57BL/6, fewer characterized Cre driver lines available on pure BALB/c background.
BALB/c vs C57BL/6
Understanding differences between BALB/c and C57BL/6 helps guide strain selection:
Immune Response
BALB/c shows Th2 bias while C57BL/6 shows Th1 bias. This affects susceptibility to infections, vaccine responses, and autoimmune phenotypes.
Susceptibility to Disease
The strains differ in susceptibility to many disease models. BALB/c is more susceptible to Leishmania major infection while C57BL/6 is resistant. C57BL/6 is more susceptible to diet induced obesity.
Behavioral Differences
BALB/c mice show higher anxiety-like behaviors than C57BL/6 in standard behavioral tests. This should be considered for neurobehavioral studies.
Metabolic Differences
C57BL/6 is more susceptible to diet induced obesity and metabolic dysfunction. BALB/c is relatively resistant to high fat diet induced weight gain.

Frequently Asked Questions
What are the key differences between BALB/c and C57BL/6 backgrounds?
BALB/c shows Th2 immune bias while C57BL/6 shows Th1 bias, affecting susceptibility to infections and autoimmune phenotypes. BALB/c is more susceptible to Leishmania major infection; C57BL/6 is resistant. C57BL/6 is more susceptible to diet-induced obesity. BALB/c shows higher anxiety-like behaviors in behavioral tests.
When should I choose BALB/c over C57BL/6 for my model?
Choose BALB/c for Th2-biased immune responses, infectious disease models where BALB/c susceptibility is advantageous, or when matching existing BALB/c-based research protocols. Choose C57BL/6 for metabolic studies, standard behavioral assays, or when using C57BL/6N ES cells for targeting.
Can I backcross my existing model to BALB/c background?
Yes. ITL provides backcrossing services to transfer models to BALB/c or other backgrounds. Contact us for more information.
How do strain backgrounds affect model phenotypes?
Genetic background profoundly influences phenotypes. The same genetic modification can show different severity, penetrance, or even opposite effects on different backgrounds. Modifier genes on different backgrounds can mask or enhance phenotypes. Consistent background use within studies is critical for reproducibility.
What is the timeline for generating a model on BALB/c background?
The typical timeline for custom mouse model generation is 6-8 months from project initiation to identification of germline transmission mice.
