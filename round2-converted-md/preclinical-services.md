Preclinical Mouse Model Services
Since 1998, Ingenious Targeting Laboratory has provided comprehensive preclinical support extending from custom model generation through in vivo studies and phenotyping. Our integrated approach enables seamless progression from model design to actionable preclinical data, eliminating handoffs between multiple service providers.
Whether you need standalone preclinical studies or end to end support from model conception through data delivery, Ingenious Targeting Laboratory offers the scientific expertise and operational infrastructure to advance your drug development program.
In Vivo Efficacy Studies
Efficacy studies evaluate therapeutic candidates in disease relevant mouse models. Ingenious Targeting Laboratory designs and executes studies using your custom models or established disease models appropriate for your therapeutic target.
Study Design
Rigorous study design is essential for generating reliable preclinical data. Our team works with you to define appropriate endpoints, group sizes, dosing regimens, and analysis plans based on your therapeutic hypothesis and regulatory requirements.
Oncology Studies
Tumor efficacy studies use syngeneic, xenograft, or genetically engineered tumor models to evaluate antitumor activity. Endpoints include tumor volume, survival, and correlative biomarkers.

Disease Model Studies
Therapeutic areas including neuroscience, metabolic disease, immunology, and cardiovascular research benefit from disease specific efficacy models. We design studies with endpoints relevant to your disease area and therapeutic approach.
Phenotyping Services
Phenotyping characterizes your mouse model across multiple parameters to understand the biological consequences of genetic modification. Comprehensive phenotyping informs experimental design and identifies unexpected phenotypes.
Basic Phenotyping
Basic phenotyping includes body weight monitoring, survival analysis, gross anatomy, and basic clinical observations. This foundational characterization identifies overt phenotypes and overall health impacts.
Clinical Chemistry and Hematology
Blood based analysis provides insight into metabolic, hepatic, renal, and hematopoietic function. Standard panels can be customized based on your research focus.
Histopathology
Tissue collection and histological analysis reveals structural changes at the cellular level. Board certified pathologists provide expert interpretation of findings.
Specialized Phenotyping
Disease specific phenotyping includes glucose tolerance testing for metabolic models, echocardiography for cardiovascular models, behavioral testing for neuroscience models, and immune phenotyping for immunology models.
Pharmacology Studies
Pharmacology studies evaluate drug pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and target engagement in your mouse models.
PK Studies
Pharmacokinetic studies determine drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion. Time course sampling enables characterization of exposure profiles.
PD Studies
Pharmacodynamic studies correlate drug exposure with biological effect. Target engagement, biomarker modulation, and downstream pathway effects demonstrate mechanism of action.
PK/PD Modeling
Integration of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data enables modeling of exposure response relationships to guide dose selection.
Integrated Preclinical Programs
Model to Data
Ingenious Targeting Laboratory's integrated capabilities enable seamless progression from custom model generation through breeding, cohort development, and preclinical studies. This eliminates the complexity and delays associated with transferring animals between service providers.
Study Coordination
Our project management team coordinates all aspects of preclinical programs, from initial model design through data delivery. Regular updates keep you informed of progress and enable adaptive study design.
Data Delivery
Preclinical study reports include complete methodology, raw data, statistical analysis, and interpretation. Data packages are formatted to support regulatory submissions and publication.
Quality and Compliance
AAALAC Accreditation
Ingenious Targeting Laboratory operates AAALAC accredited facilities meeting the highest standards for animal care and welfare.
Regulatory Alignment
Study designs and documentation are prepared with regulatory requirements in mind, supporting IND enabling studies and other regulatory submissions.
What Researchers Say

Frequently Asked Questions
What is the difference between GLP and non-GLP preclinical services?
GLP (Good Laboratory Practice) studies follow strict regulatory guidelines for documentation, quality control, and data integrity required for FDA submissions. Non-GLP studies provide exploratory data for research decisions and are more flexible in design and documentation. Most early-stage studies are non-GLP.
What types of preclinical studies can be conducted?
Services include efficacy testing (therapeutic response), PK/PD studies (pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics), safety/toxicology assessments, biomarker discovery, and combination therapy studies. Studies are customized based on your therapeutic program and regulatory requirements.
Can you conduct studies using my existing mouse models?
Yes. We can work with models you've already generated or models generated by Ingenious Targeting Laboratory. Studies can be designed using your established colonies or we can manage colony expansion and breeding as part of the service package.
What documentation is provided with preclinical studies?
All studies include comprehensive reports with methods, results, statistical analysis, and interpretation. Data tables, figures, and raw data files are provided. For regulatory studies, documentation meets GLP standards. Study reports can support IND submissions and regulatory filings.
