Tissue Specific Cre Lines
Since 1998, ingenious targeting laboratory has generated and utilized tissue specific Cre driver lines in hundreds of conditional knockout and knockin projects, providing researchers with precise spatial control of gene manipulation in specific cell types and organs.
Tissue specific Cre lines enable gene deletion or activation restricted to defined cell populations, distinguishing cell autonomous from non cell autonomous gene functions and avoiding embryonic lethality that can result from global gene manipulation.
The Power of Spatial Control
The Cre lox system combined with tissue specific Cre expression provides unprecedented precision in genetic studies:
Why Tissue Specificity Matters
Essential Gene Studies
Many genes are essential for embryonic development. Tissue specific deletion allows study of gene function in adults or in specific organs without affecting viability.
Cell Autonomous Functions
Determine whether a gene acts within a specific cell type or through effects on neighboring cells.
Disease Modeling
Many diseases affect specific tissues. Tissue restricted gene manipulation can more accurately model disease pathogenesis.
Therapeutic Relevance
Identify which cell types should be targeted by therapeutic intervention.

Inducible Cre Systems
Combine spatial and temporal control:
Tamoxifen Inducible (CreERT2)
Mechanism
Cre fused to mutant estrogen receptor (ERT2) is sequestered in cytoplasm until tamoxifen administration allows nuclear translocation.
Advantages

	•	Avoid developmental effects
	•	Adult deletion possible
Common Examples

	•	Rosa26 CreERT2**: Ubiquitous inducible
	•	CamKII CreERT2**: Inducible forebrain neurons

Doxycycline controlled Cre expression provides reversible temporal control.
Tissue Specific rtTA
Express rtTA from tissue specific promoter, TRE Cre provides inducible recombination.
Selecting the Right Cre Driver
Key Considerations
Specificity
How specific is expression to the target cell type? Some drivers have broader expression than expected.
Expression Level
Sufficient Cre expression for complete recombination? Very weak drivers may cause mosaic deletion.
Developmental Timing
When does Cre expression begin? Early expression affects all descendants; late expression spares developmental functions.
Off Target Activity
Does the driver express in unintended tissues? Germline expression causes global recombination.
Validation Approaches
Reporter Cross
Cross Cre driver to reporter line (Rosa26 tdTomato) to visualize recombination pattern.
Expression Analysis
Verify Cre expression by immunohistochemistry or in situ hybridization.
Functional Validation
Confirm expected phenotype when crossing with floxed allele.
Common Pitfalls
Germline Recombination
Problem
If Cre is active in germline, floxed allele becomes globally deleted in offspring.
Indicators

	•	Unexpected global deletion
	•	Mendelian distortion in offspring
	•	Loss of floxed allele in all tissues
Prevention

	•	Choose drivers without germline activity
	•	Maintain Cre on one gender only
	•	Monitor genotyping for unexpected recombination
Mosaic Recombination
Problem
Incomplete recombination in target tissue leaves mixture of deleted and non deleted cells.
Causes

	•	Weak Cre expression
	•	Late onset of expression
	•	Inaccessible chromatin at floxed locus
Mitigation

	•	Choose stronger drivers
	•	Use homozygous floxed allele
	•	Allow more time for recombination
Cre Toxicity
Problem
High level Cre expression can cause DNA damage independent of floxed allele.
Indicators

	•	Phenotypes in Cre positive, no flox controls
	•	Cell death in high expressing tissues
Mitigation

	•	Use appropriate controls (Cre only)
	•	Consider lower expressing drivers
	•	Use self excising Cre systems
ITL's Approach to Cre Driver Projects
Custom Cre Line Generation
ITL generates custom Cre driver lines when existing options are inadequate:
Knockin Strategy
Insert Cre into endogenous locus for expression matching native gene.
BAC Transgenic
Large genomic fragments capture regulatory elements for faithful expression.
Rosa26 Cre
Ubiquitous expression from Rosa26 safe harbor.
Sequence Verification
Intact Cre coding sequence and appropriate junctions.
What Researchers Say
“I’ve been working with iTL over the past 5 years in the production of 3 different genetically altered mice. Not only did iTL help in the design of the mice, but the entire process was transparent with the opportunity at any time along the way to discuss my questions or concerns with scientists who had significant insight into the process. The mice were delivered on time, as billed!”

Frequently Asked Questions
How do I verify that a Cre driver line works correctly before using it?
Cross the Cre driver to a reporter line (Rosa26-tdTomato or Rosa26-LacZ) before experimental crosses. This visualizes the recombination pattern and confirms expected tissue distribution and timing. Also verify Cre expression by immunohistochemistry and monitor genotyping for unexpected recombination in control tissues.
What is the difference between tissue-specific and inducible Cre drivers?
Tissue-specific Cre drivers provide spatial control (gene deleted in specific organs from development). Inducible Cre drivers (CreERT2) provide temporal control (gene deleted at specific times via tamoxifen). Tissue-specific CreERT2 drivers combine both, providing maximum control with spatial and temporal specificity.
What causes mosaic recombination and how can I improve it?
Mosaic recombination (incomplete deletion in target tissue) can result from weak Cre expression, late onset of expression, or inaccessible chromatin at the floxed locus. To improve recombination efficiency, choose stronger or more established Cre drivers, use homozygous floxed alleles (increases recombination probability), or use inducible systems for more complete activation.
How do I avoid germline recombination?
Germline recombination occurs when Cre is active in germ cells, causing global deletion in all offspring. To avoid this, choose Cre drivers without reported germline activity, maintain Cre on one gender only (maternal vs paternal inheritance), monitor genotyping for unexpected global deletion patterns, and review literature for germline activity reports for your chosen Cre driver.
What should I consider when selecting a Cre driver for conditional knockout experiments?
Key considerations include: specificity (expression limited to target cell type), expression level (sufficient for complete recombination), developmental timing (when expression begins affects which cells are targeted), background recombination (off-target activity in unintended tissues), and recombination efficiency (complete vs mosaic deletion). Always verify with reporter crosses before experimental use.
