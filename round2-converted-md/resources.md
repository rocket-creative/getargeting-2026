Mouse Model Resources
Ingenious Targeting Laboratory provides comprehensive resources to help researchers design, implement, and optimize custom mouse model projects. From selection guides that clarify strategic decisions to case studies demonstrating successful project outcomes, these resources draw on our experience from more than 2,500 projects completed since 1998.
Selection Guides
Strategy Guides
Making the right design decisions early in your project maximizes research value and minimizes timeline. These guides help you navigate key strategic choices:
(/knockout-strategy-guide)
Compare global knockout, conditional knockout, and knockout first approaches. Understand when each strategy provides optimal research outcomes and how to match your approach to specific research questions.
(/conditional-vs-conventional-guide)
Detailed comparison of conditional and conventional knockout strategies including timeline considerations, cost factors, and flexibility for future research applications.
(/humanization-strategy-guide)
Navigate decisions about gene replacement, receptor humanization, and immune checkpoint humanization. Understand technical considerations and research application implications.
(/reporter-selection-guide)
Compare fluorescent proteins, enzymatic reporters, and bioluminescent systems. Match reporter characteristics to your imaging modality and research requirements.
(/cre-line-selection-guide)
Identify appropriate Cre driver lines for tissue specific gene deletion. Understand recombination efficiency, specificity considerations, and available resources.
Planning Guides
(/model-generation-timeline)
Detailed breakdown of project phases from targeting vector construction through germline transmission. Understand what determines timeline and options for acceleration.
(/mouse-model-budgeting-guide)
Comprehensive guide to project costs including targeting vector, ES cell targeting, microinjection, breeding, and ongoing colony maintenance considerations.
(/bench-to-breeding-guide)
End to end overview of the mouse model generation process including decision points, deliverables, and what to expect at each project phase.

Frequently Asked Questions
What resources does ITL provide for mouse model projects?
ITL provides comprehensive resources including selection guides (knockout strategy, conditional vs conventional, humanization strategy, reporter selection, Cre line selection), planning guides (model generation timeline, budgeting guide), case studies demonstrating successful project outcomes, technical resources, and FAQs addressing common project questions.
How do I choose the right knockout or knockin strategy?
Use the knockout or knockin strategy guide to compare global knockout, conditional knockout, and knockout-first approaches. Selection depends on whether the gene is essential (conditional avoids lethality), whether tissue-specific studies are needed (conditional enables spatial control), and whether temporal control is required (inducible conditional). ITL's scientific consultants provide complimentary consultation to help select optimal strategies.
Where can I find case studies of successful projects?
Case studies are available in the resources section and include examples of conditional knockout for embryonic lethal genes, humanized immune checkpoint models, reporter knockin for lineage tracing, and large-scale targeting for BAC integration. These demonstrate how ITL approaches complex targeting challenges and delivers research-ready models.
How do I access ITL's technical resources?
Technical resources including selection guides, planning guides, case studies, and FAQs are available in the resources section. ITL's scientific consultants also provide complimentary project design consultations to help plan optimal mouse model strategies.
