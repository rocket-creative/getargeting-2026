Tag Knockin Mice
Since 1998, Ingenious Targeting Laboratory has generated epitope tag knockin models that enable detection, purification, and study of endogenous proteins. Tag knockin mice express epitope tagged proteins from the endogenous locus, providing physiological expression levels without requiring gene specific antibodies.
Whether you need FLAG, HA, V5, Myc, or other epitope tags, Ingenious Targeting Laboratory designs and generates tag knockin alleles optimized for your specific protein detection and purification goals.
Why Use Tag Knockin Models
Overcoming Antibody Limitations
High quality antibodies are not available for every protein of interest. Even when antibodies exist, they may not work in all applications such as immunoprecipitation, ChIP, or live cell imaging. Tag knockin models provide standardized detection reagents that work reliably across multiple applications.
Physiological Expression Levels
Unlike overexpression approaches, tag knockin preserves endogenous regulatory control. The tagged protein is expressed at normal levels from the native promoter, avoiding artifacts associated with ectopic or overexpressed constructs.
Consistent Detection Across Conditions
Epitope tag antibodies work identically regardless of the tagged protein's identity. This enables standardized protocols for detection and purification that work reliably across different target proteins.
Common Epitope Tags
FLAG Tag
The FLAG tag (DYKDDDDK) is an 8 amino acid peptide with excellent antibody availability and low immunogenicity. FLAG tagged proteins can be detected by immunoblotting, immunofluorescence, and flow cytometry, and purified by anti FLAG affinity chromatography.
Multiple FLAG copies (3xFLAG) increase detection sensitivity for low abundance proteins.

HA Tag
The HA tag (YPYDVPDYA) derives from influenza hemagglutinin and provides robust detection with widely available antibodies. HA is particularly useful for immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation applications.
(/ha-tag-knockin)
V5 Tag
The V5 tag (GKPIPNPLLGLDST) from simian virus 5 provides sensitive detection with minimal cross reactivity. V5 is often used when multiple tagged proteins need to be distinguished in the same experiment.
Myc Tag
The Myc tag (EQKLISEEDL) from c Myc provides excellent immunoprecipitation performance and works well for protein interaction studies.
His Tag
Polyhistidine tags (typically 6xHis) enable affinity purification using nickel or cobalt resins. His tags are particularly useful when large scale protein purification from tissue is required.
Tag Placement Considerations
N Terminal Tagging
N terminal tags are positioned immediately after the start codon. This placement is appropriate when the protein's C terminus is functionally important or when the N terminus is accessible for antibody binding.
N terminal tagging may interfere with signal peptide cleavage for secreted proteins or with N terminal modifications.
C Terminal Tagging
C terminal tags are positioned immediately before the stop codon. This placement is appropriate when the protein's N terminus is functionally important or when the C terminus is accessible.
C terminal tagging may interfere with C terminal processing or with GPI anchor addition for membrane proteins.
Internal Tagging
For proteins where both termini are functionally important, internal tag placement in a flexible loop region may preserve protein function while enabling detection.
Linker Sequences
Flexible linker sequences between the tag and the protein can improve accessibility for antibody binding and reduce steric interference with protein function.
Applications of Tag Knockin Models
Protein Detection and Localization
Tag knockin enables detection of endogenous proteins in tissues and cells using anti tag antibodies. This is particularly valuable when gene specific antibodies are unavailable or unreliable.
Protein Purification
Affinity purification using anti tag resins enables isolation of endogenous protein complexes for mass spectrometry analysis, enzymatic studies, or structural biology.
Chromatin Immunoprecipitation
ChIP with anti tag antibodies enables mapping of transcription factor binding sites when ChIP grade antibodies for the protein of interest are unavailable.
Protein Interaction Studies
Immunoprecipitation of tagged proteins followed by mass spectrometry identifies interacting partners under physiological conditions.
Live Imaging
Fluorescent protein tags enable live imaging of protein dynamics. GFP, mCherry, tdTomato, and other fluorescent tags can be knocked in to enable real time visualization.

Tag Knockin Design Considerations
Allele Architecture
Tag knockin alleles are designed to insert the epitope tag sequence in frame with the target protein coding sequence. 
Validation Strategy
Tagged protein expression is validated by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence using anti tag antibodies. Comparison with untagged littermates confirms specificity of detection.

Frequently Asked Questions
What epitope tags are available for knockin models?
Common tags include FLAG, HA (hemagglutinin), V5, Myc, and His tags. Tag selection depends on antibody availability, compatibility with your experimental systems, and whether the tag needs to be cleavable. FLAG and HA are most commonly used due to excellent antibody quality and commercial availability.
How do I choose between N-terminal and C-terminal tag placement?
Tag placement depends on protein structure and function. N-terminal tags can interfere with signal peptides or membrane targeting sequences. C-terminal tags avoid signal sequence issues but may affect protein-protein interactions at the terminus. Our scientific team discusses your target protein structure and tag positioning.
Can tagged proteins be used for live imaging?
Yes, but standard epitope tags (FLAG, HA, V5) require fixation and antibodies for detection. For live imaging, fluorescent protein tags (GFP, mCherry, tdTomato) are used instead. These can be knocked in similarly to epitope tags and enable real-time visualization of protein localization and dynamics in living cells and tissues.
What is the advantage of tag knockin over using gene-specific antibodies?
Tag knockins provide consistent, reliable detection without requiring high-quality gene-specific antibodies, which may not exist or may have poor specificity. Tag antibodies are well-characterized and work across many applications (Western blot, immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence). Tagged proteins are expressed at physiological levels under native regulation, avoiding overexpression artifacts.
