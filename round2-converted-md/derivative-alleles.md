Derivative Allele System
Since 1998, Ingenious Targeting Laboratory has used the derivative allele system to maximize flexibility and value for researchers. This approach generates multiple functional allele configurations from a single ES cell targeting project, providing knockout, conditional knockout, and reporter capabilities without additional targeting work.
The derivative allele system uses a sophisticated cassette design that can be converted between different allele states through simple breeding crosses to Cre or Flp deleter strains. A single investment in targeting generates alleles suitable for global knockout studies, tissue specific conditional knockouts across multiple organs, and reporter analysis of gene expression patterns.
This approach has become the standard for major international consortia including EUCOMM and KOMP, and Ingenious Targeting Laboratory applies the same strategy to custom projects, ensuring maximum return on your model generation investment.
The Four Derivative Alleles
tm1a: Knockout First (Reporter)
The tm1a allele is the initial targeted allele containing the full cassette:
	•	Structure:** FRT — LacZ/neo — loxP — critical exon — loxP
	•	Function:** Gene disrupted by splice acceptor and polyadenylation signal in cassette
	•	Reporter:** LacZ reports endogenous gene expression pattern
	•	Utility:** Provides immediate knockout phenotype plus expression data
The tm1a allele functions as a null because the cassette interrupts normal splicing, but the critical exon remains present and flanked by loxP sites for future conversion.
tm1b: Null Allele
The tm1b allele is generated by Cre mediated excision of tm1a:
	•	Conversion:** Cross tm1a to Cre deleter strain
	•	Structure:** Critical exon and cassette excised together
	•	Function:** Definitive null allele with deletion of essential sequence
	•	Utility:** Clean knockout for phenotypic studies
The tm1b allele provides a definitive null when the knockout first phenotype needs confirmation or when removal of the cassette is desired.
tm1c: Conditional Ready (Floxed)
The tm1c allele is generated by Flp mediated excision of tm1a:
	•	Conversion:** Cross tm1a to Flp deleter strain
	•	Structure:** LacZ/neo cassette removed; loxP flanked exon remains
	•	Function:** Gene function restored; conditional deletion enabled
	•	Utility:** The floxed allele for tissue specific knockout studies
The tm1c allele is the conditional ready allele. Gene expression and function are normal until crossed to a Cre driver, enabling tissue specific or temporal gene deletion.
tm1d: Conditional Null
The tm1d allele is generated by Cre mediated excision of tm1c:
	•	Conversion:** Cross tm1c to tissue specific Cre driver
	•	Structure:** Critical exon excised in Cre expressing cells
	•	Function:** Null allele in specific tissues; normal elsewhere
	•	Utility:** Tissue specific knockout for dissecting gene function
The tm1d allele represents the final conditional knockout state, with gene deletion restricted to cells expressing the chosen Cre driver.
Cassette Design
Standard Configuration
The derivative allele cassette contains several functional elements:
5' — FRT — SA — LacZ — pA — loxP — hBactP — neo — pA — FRT — loxP —  — loxP — 3'
	•	SA (Splice Acceptor):** Captures transcript upstream of cassette
	•	LacZ:** Beta galactosidase reporter for expression analysis
	•	pA (Polyadenylation signal):** Terminates transcript, creating knockout
	•	loxP sites:** Enable Cre mediated excision
	•	FRT sites:** Enable Flp mediated excision
	•	neo:** Neomycin resistance for ES cell selection
	•	Critical Exon:** Essential exon flanked by loxP for conditional deletion

tm1c Applications
	•	Tissue specific knockouts:** Cross to any Cre driver for targeted deletion

	•	Temporal studies:** Use inducible Cre for adult onset deletion
	•	Control animals:** tm1c without Cre serves as floxed control
tm1d Applications
	•	Cell autonomous function:** Determine if phenotype is cell intrinsic
	•	Essential gene studies:** Bypass lethality with tissue restricted deletion
	•	Therapeutic modeling:** Model tissue specific drug effects

Breeding Strategy Example
Goal: Generate liver specific knockout from tm1a allele
	•	Cross tm1a/+ to Flp deleter → obtain tm1c/+ offspring
	•	Intercross tm1c/+ → obtain tm1c/tm1c homozygotes
	•	Cross tm1c/tm1c to Albumin Cre → obtain tm1c/+ Alb Cre offspring
	•	Cross tm1c/+ Alb Cre to tm1c/tm1c → obtain tm1c/tm1c Alb Cre (liver specific KO)

Technical Considerations
Pre Germline Characterization
ES cell based targeting enables verification of derivative allele cassette structure before mouse generation:
	•	Confirm correct cassette integration and orientation
	•	Verify loxP and FRT site positions
	•	Test LacZ expression in ES cells
	•	Ensure proper splice acceptor function
Critical Exon Selection
The exon flanked by loxP sites must be carefully selected:
	•	Present in all transcript variants
	•	Encodes essential functional domain
	•	Deletion causes frameshift in downstream exons
	•	Intronic loxP sites do not disrupt splicing

Frequently Asked Questions
What is the derivative allele system and why is it useful?
The derivative allele system generates four different allele configurations (tm1a, tm1b, tm1c, tm1d) from a single targeting event. This maximizes research flexibility: one project can support reporter studies, conventional knockouts, and conditional knockouts across multiple tissues. It's cost-effective because derivative conversions only require breeding, not additional targeting.
How do I convert tm1a to tm1c (conditional-ready floxed allele)?
Cross the tm1a allele to a Flp deleter strain (e.g., ACTB-Flpe or Rosa26-Flpo). Flp recombinase removes the FRT-flanked selection cassette (LacZ and Neo), leaving only loxP sites flanking the critical exon. The resulting tm1c allele has normal gene function and is ready for conditional knockout experiments.
Can I use the same tm1c floxed allele with different Cre drivers?
Yes. This is a major advantage of the derivative system. A single tm1c floxed allele can be crossed to any Cre driver line to achieve tissue-specific knockout in different organs. One tm1c project can support studies in liver (Albumin-Cre), brain (Nestin-Cre), immune cells (LysM-Cre), and many other tissues.
What is the difference between tm1b and tm1d?
tm1b is a global null allele generated by crossing tm1a to a germline Cre deleter, producing gene deletion in all tissues from conception. tm1d is a conditional null allele generated by crossing tm1c to a tissue-specific Cre, producing gene deletion only in Cre-expressing tissues. Use tm1b for global knockout controls; use tm1d for tissue-specific experiments.
