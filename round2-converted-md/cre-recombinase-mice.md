Cre Recombinase Mice
Since 1998, Ingenious Targeting Laboratory has utilized Cre recombinase technology in over 1,500 conditional knockout and knockin projects, enabling researchers to achieve precise spatial and temporal control of gene expression in mouse models.
Cre recombinase mice express the Cre enzyme in specific tissues or cell types, allowing targeted deletion or activation of floxed alleles. This technology transforms conditional alleles into functional knockouts or knockins only where Cre is expressed, preserving normal gene function elsewhere.
How Cre Recombinase Works
Cre recombinase is a 38 kDa enzyme derived from bacteriophage P1 that catalyzes site specific recombination between loxP sequences without requiring cofactors or additional proteins.
Mechanism of Action
Recognition: Cre recognizes the 34 base pair loxP sequence, which consists of two 13 base pair inverted repeats flanking an 8 base pair asymmetric spacer region.
Recombination: When two loxP sites flank a DNA segment in the same orientation, Cre excises the intervening sequence as a circular DNA molecule, leaving a single loxP site behind.
Irreversibility: Excision is essentially irreversible in vivo because the excised circle is rapidly degraded and the probability of reintegration is extremely low.
Recombination Outcomes
Same Orientation loxP Sites: Excision of the flanked sequence. This is the basis for conditional knockout strategies.
Opposite Orientation loxP Sites: Inversion of the flanked sequence. Used for conditional activation or gene switches.
loxP Sites on Different Chromosomes: Chromosomal translocation. Rarely used but possible.

Inducible Cre Systems
Temporal control through drug administration:
Tamoxifen Inducible (CreERT2): Cre fused to mutant estrogen receptor. Inactive until tamoxifen administration releases Cre to enter nucleus.

Selecting the Right Cre Line
Expression Pattern Verification
Published Characterization: Review literature for Cre activity patterns. The Jackson Laboratory Cre Portal provides expression data for many lines.
Reporter Cross: Cross Cre line to Rosa26 reporter (tdTomato, LacZ, GFP) to visualize actual recombination pattern in your hands.
Tissue Specificity: Some Cre lines have broader expression than names suggest. Albumin Cre may have some biliary expression; Nestin Cre expresses in some non neural tissues.
Timing Considerations
Developmental Timing: When does Cre expression begin? Early Cre activity may cause embryonic phenotypes masking adult function.
Cell Lineage Effects: Cre marks cell lineage permanently. Nestin Cre recombination persists in all neuronal progeny even after Nestin expression ceases.
Efficiency Factors
Recombination Efficiency: Not all Cre lines achieve 100% recombination. Efficiency varies by target locus, Cre expression level, and loxP site accessibility.
Mosaicism: Incomplete recombination creates mosaic tissues. May be acceptable or problematic depending on experimental goals.
Cre Line Quality Considerations
Germline Recombination
Some Cre lines exhibit unintended germline activity:
Problem: Cre expression in germ cells causes global recombination transmitted to offspring, eliminating conditional control.
Detection: Always genotype for recombined allele in non Cre expressing tissues or use reporter crosses.
Solutions: Maintain floxed allele through female if Cre is male germline active. Use Cre lines validated for germline silence.
Cre Toxicity
High Cre expression can cause cellular toxicity independent of target gene:
DNA Damage: Cre can act at pseudo loxP sites in the genome, causing DNA breaks.
Growth Defects: Some tissues show growth abnormalities with chronic high Cre expression.
Controls: Include Cre positive, flox negative controls to distinguish Cre toxicity from gene deletion phenotypes.
Background Strain
Cre Line Background: Most Cre lines maintained on mixed or C57BL/6 backgrounds.
Matching Backgrounds: Cross Cre and floxed lines on same background to avoid strain confounds.
(/c57bl6-mouse-background)
Breeding Strategies
Standard Cross
Strategy: Cross Cre/+ mice to flox/flox mice. Offspring: Cre/+; flox/+ (heterozygous conditional) and +/+; flox/+ (control).
Intercross: Mate Cre/+; flox/+ mice to generate Cre/+; flox/flox (homozygous conditional knockout).
Maintaining Colonies
Separate Lines: Maintain Cre and floxed lines separately to prevent unwanted recombination.
Genotyping: PCR for Cre transgene and floxed allele. Include primers detecting recombined allele.
Complex Genetics
Multiple Floxed Alleles: Single Cre can delete multiple floxed genes simultaneously.
Cre Plus Reporter: Include Rosa26 reporter to track recombination pattern.
Inducible Plus Tissue Specific: Combine tissue specific promoter with CreERT2 for intersectional control.

Targeted Transgenics: Insert Cre expression cassette at Rosa26 for reliable expression.
Floxed Allele Design
Optimal Cre dependent conditional alleles require careful loxP placement:

loxP Positioning: Place sites in introns to preserve normal splicing before recombination.
Selection Cassette: FRT flanked Neo cassette removable after ES cell selection.

Frequently Asked Questions
How do I choose the right Cre driver line for my experiment?
Cre driver selection depends on target cell type, timing requirements, and expression specificity. Tissue-specific Cre lines (Albumin-Cre for hepatocytes, Nestin-Cre for neural cells) provide spatial control. Inducible Cre (CreER) provides temporal control. Consider Cre expression timing, efficiency, and potential germline activity when selecting.
What is germline recombination and how do I avoid it?
Germline recombination occurs when Cre is active in germ cells, causing global recombination that is transmitted to offspring, eliminating conditional control. To avoid this, use Cre lines validated for germline silence, maintain floxed alleles through the non-Cre-expressing parent, and genotype for recombined alleles in non-Cre tissues.
How efficient is Cre-mediated recombination?
Cre recombination efficiency varies by target locus, Cre expression level, and loxP site accessibility. Not all Cre lines achieve 100% recombination, and mosaicism (incomplete recombination) can occur. Always include Cre-positive, flox-negative controls to distinguish Cre toxicity from gene deletion phenotypes.
What should I consider about Cre toxicity?
High Cre expression can cause cellular toxicity independent of target gene deletion through DNA damage at pseudo-loxP sites. Include Cre-positive, flox-negative controls to distinguish Cre toxicity from gene deletion phenotypes. Some tissues show growth abnormalities with chronic high Cre expression.
