PDL1 Humanized Mouse
Since 1998, Ingenious Targeting Laboratory has supported immuno oncology researchers with custom humanized mouse models for checkpoint immunotherapy development. Our PDL1 humanized mice enable direct testing of anti human PDL1 therapeutic antibodies in immunocompetent mouse systems, supporting preclinical evaluation of atezolizumab, durvalumab, avelumab, and novel anti PDL1 candidates.
PDL1 (programmed death ligand 1, encoded by CD274) is expressed on tumor cells, antigen presenting cells, and other cell types, providing the ligand for the PD1 checkpoint receptor. Therapeutic antibodies targeting PDL1 block the PD1/PDL1 interaction, releasing T cell inhibition and enabling anti tumor immunity. Because anti PDL1 antibodies are designed specifically for human PDL1, humanized models are essential for preclinical efficacy testing.
Ingenious Targeting Laboratory generates custom PDL1 humanized mice tailored to your specific research requirements, supporting both monotherapy evaluation and combination studies with other checkpoint inhibitors.
Why Humanize PDL1
Species Specificity of Therapeutic Antibodies
Anti PDL1 therapeutic antibodies are engineered specifically for human PDL1:
	•	Antibody epitopes designed against human CD274 sequence
	•	Limited cross reactivity with mouse PDL1
	•	Cannot evaluate efficacy in wildtype mice
	•	Humanized models enable testing of clinical candidates
PDL1 humanization provides the human target necessary for evaluating anti PDL1 therapeutics.
PDL1 Expression Biology
PDL1 is expressed on multiple cell types relevant to tumor immunity:
	•	Tumor cells:** Direct expression for immune evasion
	•	Dendritic cells:** Regulation of T cell priming
	•	Macrophages:** Tumor associated macrophage function
	•	Other immune cells:** Broad immune regulation
Humanized PDL1 in all expressing cell types enables comprehensive evaluation of anti PDL1 effects across the tumor microenvironment.
Translational Relevance
Humanized models improve translation to clinical outcomes:
	•	Test the actual clinical candidate
	•	Evaluate on target effects with human protein engagement
	•	Assess PDL1 expression and blocking in tumor tissue
	•	Support biomarker development with human specific reagents
Humanization Strategies
Extracellular Domain Humanization
Replace the mouse PDL1 extracellular domain with human sequence:
	•	Human extracellular domain provides antibody binding epitopes
	•	Mouse transmembrane and intracellular domains preserved
	•	Normal downstream signaling maintained
	•	Compatibility with mouse immune system
Extracellular domain humanization is optimal for therapeutic antibody testing where antibody binding to the surface exposed protein is the primary consideration.
Complete Gene Humanization
Full replacement of mouse Cd274 with human CD274:
	•	Complete human PDL1 protein sequence
	•	Human specific expression characteristics
	•	Study human PDL1 biology comprehensively
	•	Appropriate for mechanistic studies beyond antibody testing
Considerations for PDL1 Humanization
PDL1 humanization has specific considerations:
	•	PDL1 expressed on host immune cells and tumor cells
	•	Syngeneic tumors continue to express mouse PDL1
	•	For complete humanization of tumor PDL1, consider human PDL1 expressing tumor cell lines
	•	Host humanization sufficient for many applications
Applications
Anti PDL1 Antibody Efficacy Testing
Primary application for PDL1 humanized mice:
	•	Test atezolizumab, durvalumab, avelumab, and other clinical antibodies
	•	Evaluate novel anti PDL1 candidates
	•	Compare antibody characteristics and potency
	•	Assess ADCC and other Fc effector contributions
Combination Immunotherapy
PDL1 humanized mice support combination studies:
	•	Anti PDL1 plus chemotherapy
	•	Anti PDL1 plus targeted therapy
	•	Anti PDL1 plus radiation
	•	Anti PDL1 plus anti PD1 (dual humanized models for mechanistic studies)
Tumor Model Compatibility

Note that syngeneic tumors express mouse PDL1. Host PDL1 humanization enables testing of antibody effects on host immune and stromal cell PDL1, which is often the predominant effect in checkpoint blockade.
PDL1 as Biomarker
Humanized models support PDL1 biomarker studies:
	•	Test clinical grade anti human PDL1 diagnostic antibodies
	•	Evaluate PDL1 expression scoring in humanized tissues
	•	Develop companion diagnostic approaches
	•	Correlate PDL1 expression with response

Technical Considerations
Pre Germline Characterization
ES cell based targeting enables comprehensive characterization of PDL1 humanized alleles before mouse generation:
	•	Sequence verification confirms exact human sequence integration
	•	Junction analysis verifies mouse to human transitions
	•	Expression testing confirms human PDL1 protein
	•	Antibody binding validation in ES cells where applicable
Pre germline characterization ensures that humanized mice express functional human PDL1 that engages therapeutic antibodies as intended.
Strain Background
Choose strain background based on experimental requirements:
	•	C57BL/6:** Compatible with MC38, B16, LLC, E0771
	•	BALB/c:** Compatible with CT26, 4T1, EMT6
(/c57bl6-mouse-background)
Functional Validation
Validate humanized PDL1 function in your experimental system:
	•	Confirm human PDL1 surface expression
	•	Verify therapeutic antibody binding
	•	Test functional checkpoint blockade
	•	Assess PDL1 expression on relevant cell types

What Researchers Say
"The quality of service was exceptional and performed to the highest possible standards.

— **Albert Basson, PhD**, King's College London
“iTL produced four conditional knockout mouse models on our behalf. They have been extremely helpful and informative at all stages of the project; all the way from construct design to breeding strategies and genotyping the new mouse models. I know where to turn when the need comes up again for another mouse project; it is certainly faster and cheaper than doing this by ourselves.”
– **William A. Coetzee, DSc NYU School of Medicine

Frequently Asked Questions
What is the difference between full humanization and ECD-only humanization for PDL1?
Full humanization replaces the entire mouse PDL1 gene with human PDL1 sequence. ECD-only humanization replaces only the extracellular domain while retaining mouse transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. Full humanization is preferred for antibody testing; ECD-only may preserve some mouse signaling functions.
Can PDL1 humanized mice be combined with other checkpoint humanizations?
Yes. PDL1 humanization can be combined with PD1, CTLA4, LAG3, TIM3, or other checkpoint humanizations to create double, triple, or multi-checkpoint models. PD1+PDL1 dual humanization enables comprehensive study of the checkpoint axis.
How do you validate human PDL1 expression in humanized models?
Pre-germline characterization includes Southern blot analysis to confirm correct targeting and sequence verification to ensure human sequence fidelity. Post-germline validation includes flow cytometry for surface expression on tumor cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages, Western blot for protein expression, and functional confirmation through binding of anti-PDL1 antibodies (atezolizumab, durvalumab).
What is the timeline for generating PDL1 humanized mice?
Standard custom model generation takes 26-36 weeks from project initiation to delivery of germline-transmitted founders. Humanized models follow the same timeline. Pre-germline characterization enables early validation of targeting and human sequence confirmation before mouse generation.
How do PDL1 humanized models work with syngeneic tumors?
PDL1 humanized mice on C57BL/6 background work with syngeneic tumor models (MC38, B16, LLC, E0771). Note that syngeneic tumors express mouse PDL1, but host PDL1 humanization enables testing of antibody effects on host immune and stromal cell PDL1, which is often the predominant effect in checkpoint blockade.
