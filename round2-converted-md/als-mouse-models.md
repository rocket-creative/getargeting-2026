ALS Mouse Models
Since 1998, ingenious targeting laboratory has supported amyotrophic lateral sclerosis research with custom mouse models enabling mechanistic studies of motor neuron degeneration, evaluation of neuroprotective strategies, and preclinical testing of disease modifying therapeutics.
ALS mouse models provide essential platforms for investigating the molecular pathways underlying motor neuron death, testing hypotheses about protein aggregation and RNA metabolism, and developing therapies targeting SOD1, TDP43, FUS, C9orf72, and other genetically validated targets.
Genetic Basis of ALS
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is characterized by progressive degeneration of upper and lower motor neurons, leading to muscle weakness, paralysis, and death typically within 3 to 5 years of diagnosis. While most cases are sporadic, approximately 10% are familial with identifiable genetic causes.
Major ALS Genes
SOD1 (Superoxide Dismutase 1)
The first ALS gene identified, with over 180 known mutations. SOD1 mutations cause disease through toxic gain of function rather than loss of enzyme activity. The G93A mutation is the most commonly studied in mouse models.
TARDBP (TDP43)
TDP43 pathology is present in approximately 97% of ALS cases, making it a central player in disease pathogenesis. Mutations cause both familial ALS and frontotemporal dementia. TDP43 mislocalization from nucleus to cytoplasm is a pathological hallmark.
FUS (Fused in Sarcoma)
Like TDP43, FUS is an RNA binding protein whose mutations cause ALS and FTD. FUS mutations lead to cytoplasmic aggregation and nuclear depletion.
C9orf72
Hexanucleotide repeat expansion in C9orf72 is the most common genetic cause of both ALS and FTD. Disease mechanisms include loss of C9orf72 function, toxic RNA foci, and dipeptide repeat protein toxicity.
Additional ALS Genes
Multiple other genes contribute to ALS risk:

	•	OPTN, TBK1, SQSTM1**: Autophagy pathway genes
	•	VCP**: Protein quality control
	•	PFN1**: Cytoskeleton dynamics
	•	UBQLN2**: Protein degradation
	•	CHCHD10**: Mitochondrial function
Model Types for ALS Research
SOD1 Models
SOD1 transgenic mice remain the most widely used ALS models:
SOD1 G93A Transgenic
High copy number transgenic mice expressing human SOD1 with the G93A mutation develop aggressive motor neuron disease with paralysis onset around 90 days. This model is extensively characterized and commonly used for therapeutic testing.
SOD1 G85R and Other Variants
Alternative SOD1 mutations produce different disease kinetics. G85R mice develop slower disease progression, providing a longer therapeutic window.
SOD1 Knockin Models
Point mutation knockins express mutant SOD1 from the endogenous locus at physiological levels. These models may better reflect human disease without overexpression artifacts.
SOD1 Knockout
Sod1 null mice are viable but show age dependent motor neuron loss and muscle denervation. Combined with mutant SOD1 expression, knockout of endogenous Sod1 can modify disease phenotype.
TDP43 Models
TDP43 models address the most common ALS pathology:
TDP43 A315T Knockin
Knockin mice expressing patient derived mutations under endogenous regulatory control. These models avoid overexpression while modeling the genetic lesion.
TDP43 Q331K Knockin
Another patient mutation producing age dependent motor phenotypes and TDP43 pathology.
TDP43 M337V and Other Variants
Multiple patient mutations have been modeled to understand genotype phenotype relationships.
Conditional TDP43 Models
Cre dependent expression or deletion enables study of TDP43 function in specific cell types. Motor neuron specific or astrocyte specific manipulations reveal cell autonomous and non cell autonomous disease mechanisms.
TDP43 Knockout
Complete TDP43 loss is embryonic lethal, but conditional knockouts in motor neurons produce progressive motor phenotypes.
FUS Models
FUS models parallel TDP43 approaches:
FUS Point Mutation Knockin
Patient mutations including R521C, R521G, and P525L produce varying degrees of motor phenotype.
FUS Knockout
Fus null mice are viable with subtle phenotypes, enabling study of loss of function contributions.
Conditional FUS Models
Cell type specific manipulation reveals contributions of different cell populations to FUS pathology.
C9orf72 Models
C9orf72 repeat expansion models are technically challenging:
C9orf72 Knockout
C9orf72 null mice develop immune dysregulation and splenomegaly but limited neurodegeneration, suggesting loss of function alone is insufficient for disease.
BAC Transgenic Repeat Models
Bacterial artificial chromosome transgenics carrying the human repeat expansion develop RNA foci, dipeptide repeat proteins, and neurodegeneration.
Viral Vector Models
AAV delivered repeat RNAs or dipeptide repeats enable study of specific toxic species.
Model Design Considerations
Achieving Motor Neuron Phenotypes
ALS models should produce measurable motor neuron degeneration:
Phenotype Severity
Balance between robust phenotype for endpoint detection and humane study design. Aggressive models like SOD1 G93A have short lifespan but clear endpoints.
Age of Onset
Early onset models (3 to 4 months) enable shorter studies but may not reflect adult onset human disease. Late onset models (12+ months) may be more disease relevant but require longer studies.
Progression Rate
Rapid progression enables survival studies but leaves little time for therapeutic intervention. Slower progression provides larger treatment windows.
Cell Type Specific Approaches
ALS involves both motor neurons and surrounding glia:
Motor Neuron Specific
ChAT Cre or VAChT Cre target cholinergic neurons including motor neurons. Motor neuron specific gene manipulation reveals cell autonomous disease mechanisms.
Astrocyte Specific
GFAP Cre or Aldh1l1 Cre target astrocytes. Astrocyte specific expression of mutant SOD1 or TDP43 can induce motor neuron death, demonstrating non cell autonomous toxicity.
Microglial Specific
CX3CR1 Cre targets microglia. Microglial activation contributes to disease progression, and microglial specific gene manipulation can modify disease course.
Oligodendrocyte Specific
Mog Cre or CNP Cre target oligodendrocytes. Oligodendrocyte dysfunction may contribute to motor neuron vulnerability.
Reporter Models
Fluorescent reporters facilitate ALS research:
Motor Neuron Reporters
ChAT driven fluorescent protein expression enables visualization and isolation of motor neurons for analysis.
Pathology Reporters
TDP43 or FUS tagged with fluorescent proteins enable tracking of protein localization and aggregation.
Survival Reporters
Luciferase reporters enable longitudinal in vivo imaging of motor neuron survival.
Phenotyping ALS Models
Motor Function Assessment
Standardized motor tests quantify disease progression:
Rotarod
Motor coordination and balance. Decline in latency to fall correlates with disease progression.
Grip Strength
Forelimb and hindlimb grip strength measurement provides quantitative muscle function assessment.
Gait Analysis
Stride length, cadence, and stance time reveal motor deficits before paralysis onset.
Hanging Wire
Neuromuscular function assessment. Time to fall from inverted grid.
Survival
Endpoint defined by inability to right within 30 seconds or >20% body weight loss.
Neuropathology
Histological endpoints confirm motor neuron degeneration:
Motor Neuron Counts
Stereological quantification of ChAT positive neurons in spinal cord ventral horn.
Neuromuscular Junction Analysis
Innervation status of neuromuscular junctions in hindlimb muscles.
Protein Aggregation
Immunohistochemistry for mislocalized TDP43, SOD1 aggregates, or dipeptide repeat proteins.
Gliosis
Astrocyte (GFAP) and microglial (Iba1) activation in spinal cord.
Electrophysiology
Functional endpoints complement histology:
Compound Muscle Action Potential
Amplitude reflects functional motor unit number.
Motor Unit Number Estimation
Quantifies surviving functional motor units.
Nerve Conduction
Assesses axonal integrity and function.
ITL's Approach to ALS Models
Complex ALS Model Design
ALS research often requires sophisticated allele architectures:
Conditional Point Mutation Expression
Cre dependent expression of TDP43 or FUS mutations enables spatial and temporal control.
Reporter Fusion Knockins
Fluorescent tags on endogenous proteins enable tracking without overexpression.
Humanized Knockins
Human gene replacement enables testing of human specific therapeutics.

Frequently Asked Questions
What types of ALS mutations can be modeled in mice?
Common ALS mutations include SOD1 mutations (A4V, G93A, G37R, etc.), TDP43 mutations (A315T, M337V, Q331K, etc.), FUS mutations, and C9orf72 repeat expansions. Point mutation knockins can introduce any specific human mutation for disease modeling at physiological levels.
What motor function tests are used to assess ALS models?
Standard motor assessments include rotarod (motor coordination), grip strength (forelimb and hindlimb), gait analysis (stride length, cadence), and hanging wire test (neuromuscular function). Survival is typically the primary endpoint, defined by inability to right within 30 seconds or >20% body weight loss.
Can conditional systems be used for ALS models?
Yes. Conditional expression of ALS mutations (e.g., Cre-dependent TDP43 or FUS mutations) enables spatial and temporal control, allowing study of motor neuron-specific effects or adult-onset disease. This can avoid developmental defects and better model sporadic ALS versus familial ALS.
What is the typical disease progression timeline in ALS mouse models?
Disease progression varies by mutation and model. SOD1 G93A transgenic mice show symptom onset around 90-100 days with rapid progression. TDP43 models may show slower progression. Knockin models at physiological expression levels typically show slower, more gradual progression than transgenic models.
What strain background should I use for ALS models?
C57BL/6 is most commonly used for ALS models due to extensive characterization and behavioral baseline data. Strain background can significantly affect disease progression and survival, so maintaining consistent backgrounds is important for reproducible experiments and comparison with published data.
