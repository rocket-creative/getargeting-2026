Parkinson Mouse Model
Since 1998, ingenious targeting laboratory has supported Parkinson disease research with custom mouse models enabling mechanistic studies of dopaminergic neurodegeneration, evaluation of neuroprotective strategies, and preclinical testing of disease modifying therapeutics.
Parkinson disease mouse models provide essential platforms for investigating the molecular pathways underlying neuronal loss in the substantia nigra, testing hypotheses about alpha synuclein aggregation and spread, and developing therapies targeting LRRK2, GBA, and other genetically validated targets.
Genetic Basis of Parkinson Disease
Parkinson disease results from progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, leading to characteristic motor symptoms including tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia. While most cases are sporadic, genetic studies have identified numerous loci associated with familial and sporadic disease risk.
Familial Parkinson Disease Genes
Mutations in several genes cause monogenic forms of Parkinson disease:
SNCA (Alpha Synuclein)
Point mutations (A53T, A30P, E46K) and gene multiplications cause autosomal dominant Parkinson disease. Alpha synuclein aggregation into Lewy bodies is a pathological hallmark of both familial and sporadic disease.
LRRK2 (Leucine Rich Repeat Kinase 2)
The G2019S mutation is the most common genetic cause of Parkinson disease, accounting for up to 40% of familial cases in certain populations. Increased LRRK2 kinase activity is implicated in both familial and sporadic disease.
PARK2 (Parkin), PINK1, DJ1
Recessive mutations cause early onset parkinsonism. These genes function in mitochondrial quality control and mitophagy pathways.
GBA (Glucocerebrosidase)
Heterozygous GBA mutations are the most common genetic risk factor for sporadic Parkinson disease, increasing risk approximately fivefold.
Risk Loci from Genome Wide Association
GWAS have identified over 90 loci associated with Parkinson disease risk. Mouse models of these genes enable functional characterization of risk variants and identification of therapeutic targets.
Model Types for Parkinson Disease Research
Alpha Synuclein Models
Alpha synuclein aggregation is central to Parkinson disease pathology. Different model configurations address distinct aspects of synuclein biology:
SNCA Point Mutation Knockin
Knockin mice expressing A53T, A30P, or E46K mutations under endogenous regulatory control model the genetic lesions found in familial disease. These models typically show age dependent synuclein accumulation and variable motor phenotypes.
SNCA Overexpression
Transgenic or BAC transgenic models expressing wild type or mutant SNCA at elevated levels accelerate synuclein pathology. Human SNCA BAC transgenics express human alpha synuclein with native regulatory elements.
SNCA Knockout
Snca null mice enable study of normal synuclein function and provide backgrounds for testing synuclein based therapies. Triple knockout of all synuclein family members (alpha, beta, gamma) reveals compensatory mechanisms.
Conditional SNCA Models
Cre dependent expression allows tissue specific or temporal control of mutant synuclein expression. This approach enables modeling of synuclein spread between brain regions and testing of cell type specific contributions to pathology.
LRRK2 Models
LRRK2 mutations represent the most tractable genetic target for Parkinson disease therapy development:
LRRK2 G2019S Knockin
Knockin mice expressing the most common pathogenic mutation under endogenous control. These models enable evaluation of LRRK2 kinase inhibitors and study of mutation effects on LRRK2 substrates including Rab GTPases.
LRRK2 Kinase Dead Knockin
D1994S or other kinase inactivating mutations provide genetic evidence for kinase dependent phenotypes. Comparison with kinase inhibitor treated wild type mice validates on target effects.
LRRK2 Knockout
Lrrk2 null mice inform safety considerations for LRRK2 inhibitor development. Lung, kidney, and gastrointestinal phenotypes in knockouts guide monitoring strategies for clinical trials.
LRRK2 R1441C/G Knockin
Less common pathogenic mutations in the ROC GTPase domain. These models help establish whether different mutations converge on common pathogenic mechanisms.
Mitochondrial Pathway Models
Recessive Parkinson disease genes implicate mitochondrial quality control:
Parkin Knockout
Park2 null mice model loss of the E3 ubiquitin ligase critical for mitophagy. Combined with mitochondrial stress or crossed with other models reveals synthetic interactions.
PINK1 Knockout
Pten induced kinase 1 deficiency impairs mitophagy initiation. PINK1 knockout mice enable study of the PINK1 Parkin pathway and testing of mitochondrial targeted therapies.
DJ1 Knockout
Park7 null mice model loss of this oxidative stress sensor. DJ1 deficiency sensitizes dopaminergic neurons to toxic insults.
GBA Models
GBA mutations are the most common genetic risk factor for sporadic Parkinson disease:
GBA Point Mutation Knockin
Knockin mice expressing N370S, L444P, or other patient mutations model the partial glucocerebrosidase deficiency that increases disease risk. These models show age dependent synuclein accumulation.
Conditional GBA Knockout
Complete GBA loss is lethal (Gaucher disease), but conditional knockout in neurons or specific brain regions enables study of glucocerebrosidase deficiency in the nervous system.
Model Design Considerations
Achieving Dopaminergic Phenotypes
A major challenge in Parkinson disease modeling is achieving robust dopaminergic neurodegeneration. Several strategies enhance phenotype development:
Aging
Many genetic models require aging to 18 to 24 months for dopaminergic phenotypes to emerge. Plan studies with appropriate timelines for aged cohorts.
Genetic Combination
Crossing models (e.g., SNCA transgenic with LRRK2 knockin) can accelerate or enhance phenotypes through additive or synergistic effects.
Environmental Challenge
Genetic susceptibility combined with mitochondrial toxins (MPTP, rotenone) or inflammatory triggers may unmask phenotypes not apparent in unchallenged animals.
Background Strain
Some phenotypes are strain dependent. C57BL/6N may show different dopaminergic phenotypes than C57BL/6J due to nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase (Nnt) status and other genetic differences.
Cell Type Specific Approaches
Parkinson disease selectively affects specific neuronal populations. Conditional approaches target relevant cell types:
Dopaminergic Neuron Targeting
DAT Cre (dopamine transporter) or TH Cre (tyrosine hydroxylase) drive recombination specifically in catecholaminergic neurons. DAT Cre is more restricted to dopaminergic neurons.
Regional Specificity
En1 Cre targets midbrain dopaminergic neurons from early development. Pitx3 Cre provides an alternative midbrain driver.
Temporal Control
Tamoxifen inducible drivers (DAT CreERT2) enable gene manipulation in adult dopaminergic neurons, avoiding developmental compensation and modeling adult onset disease.
Reporter Models for Dopaminergic Neurons
Fluorescent reporters facilitate identification and study of dopaminergic neurons:
TH Reporter Knockin
GFP or tdTomato knocked into the tyrosine hydroxylase locus enables visualization and sorting of catecholaminergic neurons.
DAT Reporter
Dopamine transporter reporters specifically label dopaminergic neurons for electrophysiology, imaging, and cell isolation.
Synuclein Reporters
Fluorescent tagged synuclein knockins enable tracking of protein localization and aggregation in vivo.
Phenotyping Parkinson Disease Models
Motor Assessment
Standardized motor tests quantify parkinsonian phenotypes:
Open Field
Spontaneous locomotor activity, rearing, and movement patterns. Hypoactivity may indicate dopaminergic dysfunction.
Rotarod
Motor coordination and balance. Accelerating rotarod protocols detect subtle deficits.
Pole Test
Bradykinesia assessment. Time to descend a vertical pole correlates with dopaminergic function.
Gait Analysis
Stride length, cadence, and coordination. Automated systems provide quantitative gait parameters.
Cylinder Test
Forelimb asymmetry in unilateral lesion models. Spontaneous wall touches reveal motor lateralization.
Neuropathology
Histological endpoints confirm disease relevant pathology:
Dopaminergic Neuron Counts
Stereological quantification of TH positive neurons in substantia nigra pars compacta.
Striatal Dopamine
HPLC measurement of dopamine and metabolites in striatal tissue.
Synuclein Pathology
Immunohistochemistry for phospho synuclein (Ser129), aggregated synuclein, and Lewy body like inclusions.
Neuroinflammation
Microglial activation (Iba1), astrogliosis (GFAP), and inflammatory markers.
Complex Allele Design
Parkinson disease research often requires sophisticated allele architectures:
Conditional Point Mutation Expression
Cre dependent expression of SNCA or LRRK2 mutations enables temporal and spatial control. Knockin at the endogenous locus with loxP stop cassette provides endogenous expression levels after Cre activation.
Reporter Fusion Knockins
Fluorescent protein fusion to endogenous synuclein enables tracking of protein localization without overexpression artifacts.
Humanized Knockins
Human SNCA or LRRK2 replacing mouse orthologs enables testing of human specific therapeutic approaches.

What Researchers Say
“iTL produced four conditional knockout mouse models on our behalf. They have been extremely helpful and informative at all stages of the project; all the way from construct design to breeding strategies and genotyping the new mouse models. I know where to turn when the need comes up again for another mouse project; it is certainly faster and cheaper than doing this by ourselves.”

Frequently Asked Questions
What Parkinson's disease mutations can be modeled in mice?
Common PD mutations include SNCA (alpha-synuclein) mutations (A53T, A30P, E46K), LRRK2 mutations (G2019S, R1441C/G), PINK1 mutations, and Parkin mutations. Point mutation knockins can introduce any specific human mutation for disease modeling at physiological expression levels.
What motor tests are used to assess Parkinson's models?
Standard motor assessments include rotarod (motor coordination), pole test (bradykinesia), open field (locomotor activity), gait analysis (stride length, coordination), and cylinder test (forelimb asymmetry in unilateral models). Dopaminergic neuron counts in substantia nigra and striatal dopamine levels are key pathological endpoints.
Can conditional systems be used for Parkinson's models?
Yes. Conditional expression of PD mutations (e.g., Cre-dependent SNCA or LRRK2 mutations) enables temporal and spatial control, allowing study of dopaminergic neuron-specific effects or adult-onset disease. This can avoid developmental defects and better model sporadic versus familial PD.
What is the typical disease progression in Parkinson's mouse models?
Disease progression varies by mutation and model type. SNCA transgenic models show motor deficits and synuclein pathology over 6-12 months. LRRK2 models may show slower progression. Knockin models at physiological expression levels typically show slower, more gradual progression than transgenic models with overexpression.
What strain background is best for Parkinson's models?
C57BL/6 is most commonly used for Parkinson's models due to extensive characterization, good motor performance, and behavioral baseline data. Strain background can affect dopaminergic function and motor phenotypes, so maintaining consistent backgrounds is important for reproducible experiments.
