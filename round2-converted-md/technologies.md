Gene Targeting Technologies
Since 1998, Ingenious Targeting Laboratory has refined gene targeting technologies through more than 2,500 custom projects. Our methodology combines proven ES cell gene targeting with sophisticated allele design strategies to deliver mouse models with verified genetic modifications and predictable performance.
Understanding these technologies helps researchers design optimal targeting strategies and interpret model capabilities. Ingenious Targeting Laboratory's scientific consultants guide project design from initial concept through final allele verification.
Core Technologies
ES Cell Gene Targeting
ES cell gene targeting is a strong methodology for precise genetic modification. Ingenious Targeting Laboratory's ES cell methodology provides pre germline characterization, ensuring correct allele structure before mouse generation.
	•	Pre germline verification through PCR and RT-PCR
	•	Defined starting point with characterized ES cell clones
	•	Predictable inheritance patterns
	•	Archived ES cells for future derivative allele generation

Defined Starting Point with characterized ES cell clones provides a documented foundation for your mouse colony. Archived ES cells can generate additional mice or derivative alleles without repeating the targeting process.
Predictable Inheritance from characterized ES cell clones ensures stable transmission of the targeted allele through subsequent generations.
Ingenious Targeting Laboratory maintains C57BL/6 and 129 strain ES cells optimized for high targeting efficiency and robust germline transmission.

Homologous Recombination
Homologous recombination enables precise genetic modification by exchanging genomic sequences between the targeting vector and chromosomal DNA. This mechanism ensures:
	•	Targeted modifications occur at the intended locus
	•	Surrounding genomic architecture remains intact
	•	Single copy integration at the native chromosomal position
	•	Predictable expression under endogenous regulatory control
Ingenious Targeting Laboratory designs targeting vectors with homology arms optimized for efficient recombination while maintaining specificity for the target locus.

Conditional Systems
Cre Lox System
The Cre lox recombination system enables conditional gene modification by placing critical exons between loxP recognition sites. Cre recombinase expression, driven by tissue specific or inducible promoters, catalyzes recombination between loxP sites to delete the flanked sequence.
loxP Sites are 34 base pair sequences recognized by Cre recombinase. Ingenious Targeting Laboratory positions loxP sites in intronic regions flanking critical exons to preserve normal gene function until Cre mediated deletion.
Cre Recombinase catalyzes recombination between loxP sites. Tissue specific Cre lines restrict deletion to defined cell populations while inducible Cre systems provide temporal control.
Tissue Specific Cre Lines enable cell type restricted gene deletion. Ingenious Targeting Laboratory can recommend appropriate Cre driver lines for your research or generate custom Cre lines for novel expression patterns.

FLP FRT System
The FLP FRT system provides an orthogonal recombination approach that can work independently or in combination with Cre lox. Ingenious Targeting Laboratory uses FLP FRT primarily for:
	•	Selection cassette removal following targeting
	•	Sequential recombination in complex allele designs
	•	Dual recombinase strategies requiring independent control
(/flp-frt-system)
Inducible Systems
Inducible gene expression systems provide temporal control over genetic modifications:
Tamoxifen Inducible CreERT2 systems remain inactive until tamoxifen administration triggers nuclear translocation and recombinase activity. This enables adult onset gene deletion or activation.
Allele Design Strategies
Derivative Allele System
Ingenious Targeting Laboratory's derivative allele approach creates versatile targeted alleles that can generate multiple model types from a single targeting event. The knockout first strategy produces a tm1a allele that serves as the foundation for:
tm1a Allele (knockout first): Gene function disrupted by splice acceptor and polyadenylation signal. LacZ reporter indicates endogenous expression pattern. This allele reports gene expression while eliminating gene function.
tm1b Allele (complete null): Cre mediated deletion removes critical exon and neomycin cassette, leaving LacZ reporter intact. Clean null allele with persistent reporter expression.
tm1c Allele (conditional ready): FLP mediated deletion removes gene trap cassette, restoring gene function. Critical exon remains flanked by loxP sites for subsequent Cre mediated deletion.
tm1d Allele (conditional null): Cre mediated deletion of the tm1c allele removes the critical exon, creating a tissue specific or temporally controlled null allele.
This flexibility maximizes research value from each targeting project.

Selection Cassette Design
Selection cassettes enable identification of correctly targeted ES cell clones:
Neomycin Selection uses the neomycin phosphotransferase gene to confer G418 resistance in targeted clones.
Hygromycin Selection provides an alternative selection marker for sequential targeting or projects requiring neomycin in the final allele.
Self Excising Cassettes use Cre or FLP driven by a germline specific promoter to automatically remove selection sequences during germline transmission.
Ingenious Targeting Laboratory designs selection cassette configurations that support downstream allele conversion and minimize disruption to gene function.
(/selection-cassette-design)
Exon Selection Strategy
Critical exon selection determines allele effectiveness:
	•	Exons containing essential functional domains ensure complete loss of function
	•	Reading frame considerations predict consequences of exon deletion
	•	Exon size affects conditional allele design and loxP site placement
	•	Alternatively spliced exons may require special design considerations
Ingenious Targeting Laboratory's scientific team analyzes gene structure to recommend optimal exon targeting for your research goals.

Safe Harbor Loci
Safe harbor loci provide consistent transgene expression without disrupting endogenous gene function:
Rosa26 Locus supports strong ubiquitous expression with well characterized regulatory elements. Ingenious Targeting Laboratory's Rapid Rosa26 targeting accelerates transgenic model generation.
HPRT Locus enables X linked transgene insertion with characterized expression patterns.
Polr2a Locus provides an alternative safe harbor with minimal positional effects.

What Researchers Say
"The Hephaestin flox model made by Ingenious is now the basis for eight research publications from multiple research groups in three countries."

— **Joshua Dunaief, MD, PhD**, University of Pennsylvania
“I’ve been working with iTL over the past 5 years in the production of 3 different genetically altered mice. Not only did iTL help in the design of the mice, but the entire process was transparent with the opportunity at any time along the way to discuss my questions or concerns with scientists who had significant insight into the process. The mice were delivered on time, as billed!”

Frequently Asked Questions

How does the Cre-lox system enable conditional gene modification?
The Cre-lox system places critical exons between loxP recognition sites. Cre recombinase expression, driven by tissue-specific or inducible promoters, catalyzes recombination between loxP sites to delete the flanked sequence. This enables tissue-specific or temporal control of gene deletion, avoiding developmental lethality and modeling pharmacological intervention.
What is the difference between FLP-FRT and Cre-lox systems?
FLP-FRT is primarily used for removal of FRT-flanked selection cassettes from knockout-first alleles, enabling generation of clean conditional alleles. Cre-lox is used for conditional gene deletion. Both can be combined in dual recombinase strategies for more sophisticated allele designs requiring independent control of multiple modifications.
What are derivative alleles and how are they generated?
Derivative alleles are alternative forms of a targeted allele created through recombinase-mediated processing. For example, knockout-first (tm1a) alleles can be processed into conditional-ready (tm1c) alleles via FLP-mediated cassette removal, then into conditional knockout (tm1d) alleles via Cre-mediated exon deletion. This provides flexibility from a single targeting event.
