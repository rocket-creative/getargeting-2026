CTLA4 Humanized Mice
Since 1998, Ingenious Targeting Laboratory has generated custom knockin mouse models, including humanized immune checkpoint mice for developing next generation immunotherapies. CTLA4 humanized mice express human cytotoxic T lymphocyte associated protein 4, enabling preclinical testing of anti CTLA4 antibodies in immunocompetent mice with functional immune systems.
These models support development of ipilimumab biosimilars, novel anti CTLA4 antibodies, and combination checkpoint immunotherapy approaches for oncology research.
CTLA4 Biology and Therapeutic Relevance
Cytotoxic T lymphocyte associated protein 4 (CTLA4, CD152) is an inhibitory receptor expressed on activated T cells and constitutively on regulatory T cells. CTLA4 competes with the costimulatory receptor CD28 for binding to B7 ligands (CD80 and CD86) on antigen presenting cells, suppressing T cell activation.
CTLA4 in Cancer Immunotherapy
Blocking CTLA4 with antibodies such as ipilimumab enhances T cell activation and antitumor immunity. Ipilimumab was the first checkpoint inhibitor approved for cancer treatment and demonstrated durable responses in metastatic melanoma.
Current research focuses on optimizing CTLA4 blockade strategies, developing next generation anti-CTLA4 antibodies with improved efficacy and safety profiles, and combining CTLA4 inhibition with other immunotherapy approaches.
Species Specificity Challenge
Therapeutic anti-CTLA4 antibodies are designed to bind human CTLA4 and typically do not cross react with mouse CTLA4. This species specificity prevents efficacy testing in standard mouse models. CTLA4 humanized mice solve this problem by expressing human CTLA4, enabling preclinical evaluation of human specific antibodies.
CTLA4 Humanization Strategy
Extracellular Domain Humanization
The most common approach humanizes the extracellular domain of CTLA4 where therapeutic antibodies bind, while retaining the mouse transmembrane and intracellular domains. This design maintains normal CTLA4 signaling while enabling human antibody binding.
Complete Gene Replacement
Complete replacement of mouse CTLA4 with human CTLA4 provides a fully humanized target but may affect T cell function if human CTLA4 interacts differently with mouse signaling partners.
Allele Configuration
CTLA4 humanized alleles are typically generated as conditional designs with loxP sites flanking the humanized exons. This enables generation of tissue specific or inducible CTLA4 expression variants if needed for specialized applications.
Applications
Anti CTLA4 Antibody Development
CTLA4 humanized mice enable preclinical efficacy testing of anti-CTLA4 antibodies. Tumor bearing humanized mice can be treated with candidate antibodies to assess antitumor activity in the context of a functional immune system.
This platform supports development of novel anti-CTLA4 antibodies, ipilimumab biosimilars, and antibodies with modified Fc regions designed for enhanced or reduced effector functions.
Combination Immunotherapy
CTLA4 blockade is frequently combined with PD1/PDL1 inhibition in clinical practice. Double humanized mice expressing both human CTLA4 and human PD1 enable preclinical testing of combination checkpoint blockade strategies.

Toxicity and Safety Studies
CTLA4 humanized mice support safety assessment of anti-CTLA4 antibodies. Immune related adverse events associated with checkpoint blockade can be modeled and strategies to mitigate toxicity can be evaluated.
Mechanism of Action Studies
Understanding how anti-CTLA4 antibodies enhance antitumor immunity requires models with human CTLA4. Humanized mice enable study of antibody effects on T cell activation, regulatory T cell function, and tumor immune infiltration.
Tumor Model Compatibility
CTLA4 humanized mice are typically generated on the C57BL/6 background, providing compatibility with established syngeneic tumor models.
Compatible Tumor Lines
Syngeneic tumor lines compatible with C57BL/6 background include MC38 (colon carcinoma), B16 (melanoma), E0771 (breast carcinoma), and Lewis lung carcinoma. These models enable evaluation of anti-CTLA4 antibody efficacy in various tumor contexts.
Tumor Implantation Studies
Standard subcutaneous or orthotopic tumor implantation followed by antibody treatment enables assessment of antitumor efficacy. Endpoint analysis can include tumor growth, survival, tumor immune infiltration, and systemic immune parameters.
Available Designs
Single Immune Checkpoint Models
CTLA4 humanized mice as standalone models for anti-CTLA4 antibody development.
Double Immune Checkpoint Models
CTLA4 humanized combined with PD1 humanized for combination checkpoint blockade studies.
Triple and Multi Checkpoint Models
CTLA4 can be combined with multiple checkpoint humanizations for complex immunotherapy combination studies.
What Researchers Say

Frequently Asked Questions
What is the difference between full humanization and ECD-only humanization for CTLA4?
Full humanization replaces the entire mouse CTLA4 gene with human CTLA4 sequence. ECD-only humanization replaces only the extracellular domain while retaining mouse transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. Full humanization is preferred for antibody testing, while ECD-only may preserve some mouse signaling functions.
Can CTLA4 humanized mice be combined with other checkpoint humanizations?
Yes. CTLA4 humanization can be combined with PD1, PDL1, LAG3, TIM3, or other checkpoint humanizations to create double, triple, or multi-checkpoint models. These models enable testing of combination checkpoint blockade therapies in immunocompetent animals with human targets.
Can CTLA4 humanized mice be used with syngeneic tumor models?
Yes. CTLA4 humanized mice can be combined with syngeneic tumor cell lines to create systems where both tumor and immune compartments express human targets. This enables evaluation of checkpoint blockade in immunocompetent animals with intact tumor immunity, providing more physiologically relevant testing.
