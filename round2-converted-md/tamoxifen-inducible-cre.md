Tamoxifen Inducible Cre
Since 1998, ingenious targeting laboratory has incorporated tamoxifen inducible Cre systems into hundreds of conditional knockout and knockin projects, providing researchers with precise temporal control over gene manipulation in adult animals.
Tamoxifen inducible Cre (CreERT2) enables gene deletion at any chosen time point, avoiding developmental compensation, bypassing embryonic lethality, and enabling study of gene function in mature tissues with established physiology.
The CreERT2 System
The tamoxifen inducible system provides temporal control of Cre recombinase activity through fusion to a mutated estrogen receptor ligand binding domain.
How It Works
CreERT2 Fusion Protein
Cre recombinase is fused to the ligand binding domain of estrogen receptor alpha containing mutations (G521R or G400V/M543A/L544A) that prevent binding of endogenous estrogen but retain high affinity for synthetic ligands.
Cytoplasmic Sequestration
In the absence of ligand, the ERT2 domain associates with heat shock proteins (HSP90), sequestering the CreERT2 fusion protein in the cytoplasm away from nuclear DNA.
Tamoxifen Induction
Administration of tamoxifen (or its active metabolite 4 hydroxytamoxifen) displaces HSP90 and allows nuclear translocation of CreERT2, enabling recombination of loxP flanked sequences.
Transient Activity
CreERT2 activity is transient. Once tamoxifen is cleared, HSP90 re associates and Cre activity ceases. However, recombination events are permanent.
Advantages of Temporal Control
Avoid Developmental Effects
Bypass Embryonic Lethality
Genes essential for development can be deleted in adults after normal development is complete.
Avoid Developmental Compensation
Constitutive gene loss from fertilization may trigger compensatory mechanisms that mask phenotypes. Adult deletion avoids this adaptation.
Study Adult Gene Function
Distinguish developmental roles from adult maintenance functions.
Experimental Design Benefits
Defined Deletion Timing
Know exactly when gene deletion occurs relative to experimental manipulation.
Control Group Simplicity
Same genotype with and without tamoxifen provides matched controls.
Disease Stage Studies
Delete genes before, during, or after disease onset to distinguish initiating from amplifying roles.
Tamoxifen Administration
Dosing Routes
Intraperitoneal Injection
Most common method. Tamoxifen dissolved in corn oil or sunflower oil. Typical doses: 75 to 100 mg/kg body weight.
Oral Gavage
Direct delivery to stomach. Similar dosing to IP.
Tamoxifen Chow
Convenient for extended dosing. 250 to 500 mg tamoxifen per kg diet. Less precise timing than injection.
Topical (4 OHT)
4 hydroxytamoxifen applied topically for skin specific studies.
Standard Protocols
Single Dose Induction
One injection may suffice for highly expressed CreERT2 with easily accessible floxed locus.
Multiple Dose Induction
Typical protocol: 1 to 5 daily injections of 75 mg/kg. Improves recombination efficiency.
Waiting Period
Allow 1 to 2 weeks after final tamoxifen dose before analysis to ensure complete recombination and tamoxifen clearance.
Tamoxifen Considerations
Pregnancy Risks
Tamoxifen is teratogenic and can affect fertility. Avoid treating pregnant females or breeding shortly after treatment.
Metabolic Effects
Tamoxifen affects lipid metabolism and can have estrogenic/anti estrogenic effects depending on tissue.
Vehicle Controls
Include oil injected controls to account for any vehicle effects.

Experimental Design Considerations
Timing Recombination
Developmental Windows
Delete genes at specific developmental stages to define temporal requirements.
Adult Homeostasis
Delete in adults to study maintenance functions without developmental complications.
Disease Modeling
Time deletion relative to disease induction or progression.
Recombination Efficiency
Driver Strength
Stronger promoters generally give more complete recombination. Weak drivers may cause mosaic deletion.
Locus Accessibility
Some genomic loci are more efficiently recombined than others. Chromatin state affects Cre access.
Homozygous vs Heterozygous Flox
Homozygous floxed mice may show more complete deletion as both alleles must be targeted.
Controls
Essential Control Groups

	•	Flox/flox without CreERT2 (+ tamoxifen): Controls for tamoxifen effects
	•	CreERT2 positive without floxed allele (+ tamoxifen): Controls for Cre effects
	•	Flox/flox with CreERT2 (no tamoxifen): Controls for leaky Cre activity
Common Challenges
Incomplete Recombination
Problem
Not all target cells undergo recombination, leaving mosaic deletion.
Solutions

	•	Increase tamoxifen dose or duration
	•	Use homozygous floxed allele
	•	Choose higher expressing CreERT2 line
	•	Extend waiting period before analysis
Leaky Activity
Problem
Some recombination occurs without tamoxifen administration.
Causes

	•	High CreERT2 expression
	•	Endogenous estrogens at high concentrations
	•	Constitutive nuclear localization in some systems
Mitigation

	•	Include no tamoxifen controls
	•	Choose tighter systems (ERT2 vs older ER versions)
	•	Avoid pregnant or lactating females
Cre Toxicity
Problem
High level Cre expression can cause DNA damage and cell toxicity.
Solutions

	•	Use controls with Cre alone
	•	Consider self excising Cre designs
	•	Choose moderate expression drivers

What Researchers Say
“I’ve been working with iTL over the past 5 years in the production of 3 different genetically altered mice. Not only did iTL help in the design of the mice, but the entire process was transparent with the opportunity at any time along the way to discuss my questions or concerns with scientists who had significant insight into the process. The mice were delivered on time, as billed!”

Frequently Asked Questions
How does tamoxifen-inducible Cre (CreERT2) work?
CreERT2 is a fusion protein combining Cre recombinase with a modified estrogen receptor that is inactive until tamoxifen administration. Tamoxifen binds to the receptor, causing translocation to the nucleus where Cre becomes active and excises loxP-flanked sequences. This enables temporal control over gene deletion at specific developmental stages or in adult animals.
What is the difference between CreERT2 and regular Cre?
Regular Cre is constitutively active in cells where it's expressed, causing immediate gene deletion from the time of expression. CreERT2 remains inactive until tamoxifen administration, allowing precise temporal control. This is essential for studying gene function in adults without developmental effects or for modeling disease onset at specific times.
How do I administer tamoxifen to activate CreERT2?
Tamoxifen is typically administered via intraperitoneal injection at doses of 75-200 mg/kg body weight, depending on the CreERT2 line and desired recombination efficiency. Multiple injections over several days improve recombination efficiency. Tamoxifen can also be administered via oral gavage or in food, though injection provides more controlled dosing.
How long does it take for recombination to occur after tamoxifen treatment?
Recombination typically occurs within 2-7 days after tamoxifen administration, though timing can vary by tissue and CreERT2 line. Peak recombination is usually observed 3-5 days post-treatment. Some tissues (e.g., brain) may require longer or multiple doses for efficient recombination. Verification by reporter crosses confirms timing for specific CreERT2 lines.
Can CreERT2 be used for reversible gene regulation?
No. CreERT2 causes permanent DNA excision (deletion), which is irreversible. Once loxP-flanked sequences are excised, they cannot be restored. For reversible gene regulation, use doxycycline-inducible (Tet) systems or other reversible expression systems. CreERT2 is ideal for permanent gene deletion at specific times.
