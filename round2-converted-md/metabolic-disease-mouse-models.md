Metabolic Disease Mouse Models
Since 1998, Ingenious Targeting Laboratory has supported metabolic disease researchers with custom mouse models contributing to peer reviewed publications in Diabetes, Cell Metabolism, Nature Medicine, and leading metabolism journals worldwide. Our metabolic disease mouse models have advanced understanding of glucose homeostasis, lipid metabolism, and the pathophysiology of obesity related complications.
Metabolic disease mouse models enable researchers to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying diabetes, obesity, fatty liver disease, and metabolic syndrome. From tissue specific knockouts that isolate gene function in adipose tissue, liver, or pancreatic beta cells to humanized models for therapeutic testing, the right model design is critical for translational success. ITL designs and generates custom metabolic models tailored to your specific research questions.
Conditional approaches are particularly important in metabolic research, where gene function often differs dramatically between tissues. A gene essential for insulin secretion in beta cells may have entirely different functions in hepatocytes or adipocytes. Tissue specific conditional knockouts enable dissection of these organ specific roles.
Research Applications in Metabolic Disease
Understanding Metabolic Regulation
Genetically engineered mouse models have transformed our understanding of metabolic regulation. Knockout models reveal essential gene functions in glucose sensing, insulin signaling, lipid storage, and energy expenditure. Reporter knockins enable visualization of metabolically active cell populations and tracking of cellular fate during metabolic stress.
Conditional approaches allow gene manipulation in specific metabolic tissues at defined times, enabling dissection of gene function in adult metabolism without confounding developmental effects.
Modeling Metabolic Disease
Mouse models of metabolic diseases including type 1 and type 2 diabetes, obesity, NASH, and metabolic syndrome have been essential for understanding disease mechanisms and testing therapeutic approaches. Key modeling strategies include:
	•	Knockout models:** Study loss of function for genes regulating metabolism
	•	Knockin of disease variants:** Express human metabolic disease mutations from endogenous loci
	•	Humanization:** Replace mouse genes with human orthologs for therapeutic testing
	•	Diet induced models:** Combine genetic susceptibility with high fat diet challenge
Drug Target Validation
Metabolic disease mouse models support therapeutic development by validating drug targets and enabling preclinical efficacy testing. Conditional knockouts can model acute target inhibition, while humanized models enable testing of human specific therapeutics for diabetes and obesity.
Diabetes Mouse Models
Type 1 Diabetes Models
Type 1 diabetes models focus on autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells. Genetic approaches complement the NOD mouse background with targeted modifications to study specific aspects of autoimmune pathogenesis:
	•	Immune gene modifications:** Knockouts and knockins affecting T cell and B cell function
	•	Beta cell specific deletions:** Study genes essential for beta cell survival
	•	Reporter models:** Track immune cell infiltration and beta cell death
(/type-1-diabetes-mice)
Type 2 Diabetes Models
Type 2 diabetes models address insulin resistance and beta cell dysfunction. Tissue specific conditional knockouts are particularly valuable for dissecting the contributions of different organs:
	•	Liver specific knockouts:** Study hepatic glucose production and insulin sensitivity
	•	Adipose specific knockouts:** Investigate adipokine signaling and lipid storage
	•	Muscle specific knockouts:** Analyze glucose uptake and insulin signaling
	•	Beta cell specific knockouts:** Study insulin secretion and beta cell compensation
Combination of genetic modifications with high fat diet feeding enables study of gene environment interactions in type 2 diabetes pathogenesis.
(/type-2-diabetes-mice)
Obesity Mouse Models
Obesity mouse models enable study of energy balance, adipose tissue biology, and obesity related complications. Genetic approaches include:
	•	Leptin pathway models:** Modifications affecting leptin signaling and satiety
	•	Adipocyte specific knockouts:** Study adipose tissue development and function
	•	Hypothalamic knockouts:** Investigate central regulation of food intake
	•	Brown adipose models:** Analyze thermogenesis and energy expenditure
Conditional knockouts enable temporal control over gene deletion, allowing study of gene function in adult metabolism independent of developmental roles in adipose tissue formation.
(/obesity-mouse-models)
NASH and Liver Disease Models
Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and metabolic dysfunction associated steatohepatitis (MASH) models address the progression from simple steatosis to inflammatory liver disease and fibrosis:
	•	Hepatocyte specific knockouts:** Study lipid metabolism and stress responses in liver
	•	Stellate cell modifications:** Investigate fibrosis progression
	•	Kupffer cell knockouts:** Analyze hepatic inflammation
	•	Combination models:** Genetic susceptibility combined with dietary challenge
Multi tissue approaches are particularly valuable in NASH research, where crosstalk between adipose tissue, liver, and immune cells drives disease progression.

Technical Considerations
Strain Background Considerations
Strain background significantly impacts metabolic phenotypes. Key considerations include:
	•	C57BL/6J:** Susceptible to diet induced obesity and glucose intolerance; Nnt mutation affects insulin secretion
	•	C57BL/6N:** Different metabolic profile from C57BL/6J; intact Nnt gene
	•	BALB/c:** Relatively resistant to diet induced obesity
	•	129 strains:** Variable metabolic phenotypes depending on substrain
Our scientific team advises on optimal strain selection for metabolic phenotyping.

Derivative Allele Flexibility
The derivative allele system provides maximum flexibility for metabolic research programs:
	•	tm1a:** Reporter allele for expression pattern analysis
	•	tm1b:** Null allele for global knockout studies
	•	tm1c:** Conditional allele for tissue specific deletion
	•	tm1d:** Conditional null after Cre mediated excision
A single project generates alleles suitable for global knockout studies, tissue specific conditional knockouts across multiple organs, and reporter analysis of gene expression patterns in metabolic tissues.

Frequently Asked Questions
What metabolic tissues can be targeted for conditional knockout studies?
Common metabolic Cre drivers include Insulin-Cre (beta cells), Albumin-Cre (liver), MCK-Cre (muscle), Adiponectin-Cre (adipose tissue), and Nestin-Cre (hypothalamus). Selection depends on whether you're studying insulin secretion, glucose production, insulin action, or central metabolic control.
What is the difference between C57BL/6J and C57BL/6N for metabolic studies?
C57BL/6J has a mutation in the Nnt (nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase) gene that affects insulin secretion, making them more susceptible to diabetes. C57BL/6N has intact Nnt and different metabolic characteristics. Choose based on whether you want diabetes susceptibility (6J) or intact insulin secretion (6N).
What phenotyping assays are typically performed on metabolic disease models?
Standard assays include glucose tolerance testing (GTT), insulin tolerance testing (ITT), fasting glucose and insulin levels, body composition analysis (DEXA or MRI), and indirect calorimetry. Advanced studies may include hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps, islet perifusion, and tissue-specific insulin signaling assessments.
Can I study both type 1 and type 2 diabetes with the same model?
Some models can be used for both, depending on experimental conditions. Beta cell-specific knockouts can model type 1 diabetes through beta cell loss. The same model on a high-fat diet background may develop insulin resistance, modeling aspects of type 2 diabetes. Model selection depends on your specific research question.
How do I model obesity-related metabolic dysfunction?
Obesity models typically involve high-fat diet feeding combined with genetic modifications affecting adipose tissue, liver, or central metabolism. Conditional knockouts in adipose tissue (Adiponectin-Cre) or liver (Albumin-Cre) can be combined with dietary challenges to study how specific genes affect diet-induced obesity and metabolic dysfunction.
