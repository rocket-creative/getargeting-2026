Autoimmune Mouse Model
Since 1998, ingenious targeting laboratory has supported autoimmune disease research with custom mouse models enabling mechanistic studies of immune tolerance breakdown, autoreactive lymphocyte development, and therapeutic interventions targeting aberrant immune responses.
Autoimmune disease mouse models provide essential platforms for investigating the molecular pathways underlying loss of self tolerance, testing hypotheses about genetic susceptibility, and developing therapies for conditions including lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and type 1 diabetes.
The Challenge of Autoimmune Disease
Autoimmune diseases arise when the immune system fails to distinguish self from non self, leading to attack on the body's own tissues. Mouse models enable controlled study of specific genetic contributions to immune tolerance and autoreactivity.
Categories of Autoimmune Disease
Systemic Autoimmunity
Diseases affecting multiple organ systems, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis, and Sjogren syndrome.
Organ Specific Autoimmunity
Diseases targeting specific tissues, including type 1 diabetes (pancreas), multiple sclerosis (nervous system), and autoimmune thyroiditis.
Inflammatory Bowel Disease
Immune mediated intestinal inflammation including Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis.
Spontaneous Autoimmune Models
Lupus Prone Strains
Several inbred strains develop spontaneous lupus like disease:
MRL/lpr
Mice homozygous for the lpr mutation in Fas develop severe lupus with lymphadenopathy, autoantibodies, and glomerulonephritis. The lpr mutation impairs Fas mediated apoptosis of autoreactive lymphocytes.
NZB/W F1
Hybrid offspring of NZB and NZW strains develop lupus like disease with anti DNA antibodies and nephritis. Female predominance mirrors human SLE.
BXSB/Yaa
Male mice carrying the Y linked autoimmune accelerator (Yaa) locus develop accelerated lupus due to TLR7 gene duplication.
Type 1 Diabetes Models
NOD (Non Obese Diabetic)
Spontaneous development of autoimmune diabetes with insulitis and beta cell destruction. Female predominance. Widely used for T1D research.
NOD Modifications
Genetic modifications on NOD background enable study of specific genes in diabetes pathogenesis or protection.
Arthritis Models
K/BxN
T cell receptor transgenic model developing severe inflammatory arthritis. Serum transfer induces arthritis in naive recipients.
SKG
Zap70 mutant mice develop spontaneous rheumatoid arthritis like disease.
Induced Autoimmune Models
Imiquimod Induced Lupus
Topical TLR7 agonist imiquimod induces lupus like disease:
Mechanism
Chronic TLR7 stimulation drives type I interferon production and breaks tolerance.
Features
Splenomegaly, autoantibodies, glomerulonephritis, and skin inflammation develop over 6 to 8 weeks.
Genetic Background Effects
C57BL/6 shows moderate disease; other backgrounds may show different severity.
Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE)
Model for multiple sclerosis:
Induction
Immunization with myelin peptides (MOG, MBP, PLP) in adjuvant induces T cell mediated CNS inflammation.
Disease Course
Acute, relapsing remitting, or chronic progressive depending on antigen and mouse strain.
Therapeutic Testing
Used extensively for evaluating MS therapies.
Collagen Induced Arthritis (CIA)
Model for rheumatoid arthritis:
Induction
Immunization with type II collagen in complete Freund adjuvant.
Strain Susceptibility
DBA/1 highly susceptible; C57BL/6 relatively resistant.
Features
Synovitis, pannus formation, cartilage and bone erosion.
Gene Targeting for Autoimmune Research
Knockout Models
Gene deletion to study immune regulatory pathways:

Loss of death receptor signaling causes lymphoproliferation and lupus like disease (phenocopy of lpr and gld mutations).
CTLA4 Knockout
Severe lymphoproliferative disease demonstrating critical role of CTLA4 in immune homeostasis.
Regulatory Cytokine Knockouts
IL10, TGF beta, and IL2 knockouts develop autoimmunity, highlighting regulatory cytokine importance.
Treg Related Knockouts
Foxp3, CD25, and other regulatory T cell associated genes essential for tolerance.
Conditional Knockouts
Tissue or cell type specific gene deletion:

Key Pathways in Autoimmunity
Interferon Signaling
Type I interferons are central to many autoimmune diseases:
IFNAR Knockout
Interferon alpha/beta receptor knockout protects from lupus in multiple models.
STING Pathway
Stimulator of interferon genes links DNA sensing to type I interferon production. STING knockout reduces lupus severity.
IRF Family
Interferon regulatory factors control interferon gene expression.
B Cell Tolerance
Autoreactive B cells drive antibody mediated autoimmunity:
BCR Signaling
Modulation of B cell receptor signaling thresholds affects autoreactive B cell fate.
BAFF/APRIL
B cell survival factors influence autoreactive B cell persistence.
TLR Signaling in B Cells
Intrinsic TLR7 and TLR9 signaling promotes autoreactive B cell activation.
T Cell Tolerance
T cell mediated and T cell dependent autoimmunity:
Central Tolerance
Thymic selection eliminates most autoreactive T cells. Aire and other genes control tissue restricted antigen expression.
Peripheral Tolerance
Regulatory T cells, anergy, and deletion maintain tolerance in the periphery.
Th17 Cells
IL17 producing T helper cells drive inflammation in multiple autoimmune diseases.
Myeloid Cell Contributions
Innate immune cells amplify autoimmune responses:
Neutrophils
NETosis releases autoantigens and activates autoreactive B cells.
Macrophages
Tissue resident and infiltrating macrophages contribute to organ damage.
Dendritic Cells
Antigen presentation and cytokine production shape adaptive autoimmune responses.
Model Design Considerations
Background Strain Selection
Autoimmune phenotypes are profoundly influenced by genetic background:
C57BL/6
Relatively resistant to many autoimmune conditions. Well characterized for immune studies.
BALB/c
Different immune response profile. May be more or less susceptible depending on the model.
Autoimmune Prone Backgrounds
MRL, NZB/W, NOD carry multiple susceptibility alleles.
Mixed Background Considerations
Background genes can dramatically modify autoimmune phenotypes.

Conditional and Inducible Approaches
Autoimmune phenotypes may require temporal or spatial control:
Avoiding Developmental Effects
Tamoxifen inducible deletion in adults prevents developmental compensation.
Cell Type Specificity
Distinguish cell intrinsic from cell extrinsic gene functions using appropriate Cre drivers.
Temporal Control
Delete genes before or after disease onset to distinguish initiating from amplifying roles.

What Researchers Say
“I’ve been working with iTL over the past 5 years in the production of 3 different genetically altered mice. Not only did iTL help in the design of the mice, but the entire process was transparent with the opportunity at any time along the way to discuss my questions or concerns with scientists who had significant insight into the process. The mice were delivered on time, as billed!”

Frequently Asked Questions
What strain backgrounds are best for autoimmune disease models?
C57BL/6 is relatively resistant to many autoimmune conditions and is well-characterized for immune studies. BALB/c has different immune response profiles (Th2-biased). Autoimmune-prone backgrounds like MRL, NZB/W, and NOD carry multiple susceptibility alleles and may be appropriate for specific disease models. Strain selection significantly affects autoimmune phenotypes.
Can conditional knockouts be used for autoimmune research?
Yes. Conditional knockouts are valuable for autoimmune research to achieve cell type-specific deletion (e.g., T cell, B cell, or myeloid-specific) and to avoid developmental effects. Tamoxifen-inducible deletion in adults prevents developmental compensation and better models therapeutic intervention.
What are the key immune pathways targeted in autoimmune models?
Important pathways include interferon signaling (IFNAR, STING, IRF family), B cell tolerance (BCR signaling, BAFF/APRIL, TLR signaling), T cell tolerance (central and peripheral tolerance, regulatory T cells, Th17 cells), and myeloid cell contributions (neutrophils, macrophages, dendritic cells).
How do I model specific autoimmune diseases like lupus or rheumatoid arthritis?
Lupus models often involve interferon pathway disruptions or B cell tolerance defects on susceptible backgrounds. Rheumatoid arthritis models may target T cell or cytokine pathways. Humanized models expressing human autoantigens or cytokines enable testing of human-specific therapeutics. Model selection depends on the specific disease and research question.
What phenotyping assays are used for autoimmune models?
Standard assessments include autoantibody titers (ELISA, immunofluorescence), immune cell analysis (flow cytometry for T cells, B cells, myeloid cells), histopathology (organ-specific inflammation and damage), cytokine profiling, and functional assays (T cell proliferation, B cell activation). Disease-specific endpoints vary by autoimmune condition.
