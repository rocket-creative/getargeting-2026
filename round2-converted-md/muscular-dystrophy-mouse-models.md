Muscular Dystrophy Mouse Models
Since 1998, ingenious targeting laboratory has supported muscular dystrophy research with custom mouse models enabling mechanistic studies of muscle degeneration, testing gene therapy approaches, and developing therapeutic interventions for Duchenne muscular dystrophy and related myopathies.
Muscular dystrophy mouse models provide essential platforms for investigating the molecular pathways underlying muscle wasting, testing exon skipping strategies and gene replacement therapies, and developing treatments for patients with these devastating inherited muscle diseases.
Understanding Muscular Dystrophies
Muscular dystrophies are a group of inherited disorders characterized by progressive muscle weakness and degeneration. Mouse models enable controlled study of disease mechanisms and therapeutic development.
Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy
The most common and severe form affecting approximately 1 in 3500 male births:
Genetic Basis
X linked recessive mutations in the DMD gene eliminate functional dystrophin protein. Most mutations are deletions disrupting the reading frame.
Clinical Features
Progressive proximal muscle weakness beginning in early childhood, loss of ambulation by early teens, cardiomyopathy, respiratory failure, and shortened lifespan.
Dystrophin Function
Dystrophin links the intracellular cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix, protecting muscle fibers from contraction induced damage.
Becker Muscular Dystrophy
Milder allelic variant of DMD:
Genetic Basis
In frame deletions produce partially functional dystrophin. Disease severity correlates with amount and function of residual protein.
Clinical Features
Later onset and slower progression than DMD. Ambulatory into adulthood in most cases.
Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophies
Heterogeneous group affecting proximal muscles:
Multiple Genetic Causes
Mutations in genes encoding sarcoglycans, dysferlin, calpain, and other muscle proteins.
Variable Phenotypes
Range from severe childhood onset to mild adult onset forms.
DMD Mouse Models
The mdx Mouse
The most widely used DMD model:
Genetic Defect
Spontaneous point mutation in exon 23 creating a premature stop codon. Complete absence of full length dystrophin.
Phenotype
Milder than human DMD due to compensatory utrophin upregulation and differences in mouse muscle physiology. Shows muscle pathology, elevated CK, and muscle regeneration.
Utility
Standard model for preclinical studies but may underestimate disease severity.
mdx Variants
mdx2cv, mdx3cv, mdx4cv, mdx5cv
ENU induced mutations at different locations in Dmd gene. Different mutations useful for testing mutation specific therapies.
mdx52
Deletion of exon 52, modeling common human mutation hotspot.
Double Knockout Models
More severe phenotypes by eliminating compensatory mechanisms:
mdx/utrophin Double Knockout (dKO)
Elimination of both dystrophin and utrophin produces severe muscular dystrophy with shortened lifespan, closely modeling human DMD severity.
mdx/MyoD Double Knockout
Impaired regeneration combined with dystrophin loss.
mdx/Cmah Knockout
Humanized sialic acid metabolism combined with mdx produces more severe phenotype.
Humanized DMD Models
Full Length Human DMD Transgenic
hDMDTg mice carrying full length human DMD gene enable testing of human specific therapies.
Human Exon Knockin
Knockin of human exon sequences for testing exon skipping oligonucleotides.
Other Muscular Dystrophy Models
Sarcoglycan Deficiency
Models for limb girdle muscular dystrophies:
Alpha Sarcoglycan (Sgca) Knockout

Beta, Gamma, Delta Sarcoglycan Knockouts
Models for LGMD2E, 2C, and 2F respectively.
Dysferlin Deficiency
Dysferlin Knockout
LGMD2B and Miyoshi myopathy model. Defective membrane repair.
Dystroglycanopathy Models
LARGE Knockout
Defective dystroglycan glycosylation causes severe muscular dystrophy with brain abnormalities.
FKRP, POMT1/2 Knockouts
Additional dystroglycanopathy models.
Emery Dreifuss Muscular Dystrophy

Model Design Considerations
Choosing the Right Model
Different models serve different purposes:
Mechanism Studies
mdx mouse adequate for basic pathophysiology.
Severe Disease Phenotype
mdx/utr double knockout for testing in severely affected context.
Human Specific Therapies
Humanized models required for exon skipping and human sequence specific approaches.
Specific Mutations
Knockin of patient mutations for precision medicine development.
Conditional Approaches
Temporal and spatial control of dystrophin expression:
Muscle Specific
MCK Cre or HSA Cre for skeletal muscle specific studies.
Cardiac Specific
Alpha MHC Cre for cardiomyopathy studies.
Inducible
Tamoxifen inducible deletion for adult onset studies.

Background Strain Considerations
Phenotype severity varies with background:
C57BL/6
Standard mdx background. Milder phenotype due to robust regeneration.
DBA/2
More severe fibrosis and weakness on this background.
Mixed Backgrounds
Modifier genes from different strains affect phenotype.
Phenotyping Muscular Dystrophy Models
Functional Assessment
Grip Strength
Forelimb and hindlimb strength measurement. Progressive decline in severe models.
Rotarod
Motor coordination and fatigue.
Treadmill Endurance

Serum Biomarkers
Creatine Kinase (CK)
Elevated in dystrophic muscle due to membrane instability.
Other Biomarkers
Myoglobin, cardiac troponin for cardiomyopathy.
Cardiac Assessment
Echocardiography
Ejection fraction, fractional shortening, chamber dimensions.
ECG
Arrhythmias, conduction abnormalities.
Hemodynamics
Pressure volume relationships for detailed cardiac function.

Frequently Asked Questions
What types of muscular dystrophy models are available?
Muscular dystrophy models include mdx (Duchenne muscular dystrophy model with dystrophin mutation), knockout models of dystrophin-associated proteins, point mutation knockins modeling specific patient variants, and conditional models for tissue-specific studies. Models can be combined with gene therapy or therapeutic testing approaches.
How do you phenotype muscular dystrophy mouse models?
Phenotyping includes functional assessment (grip strength, rotarod, treadmill endurance, voluntary wheel running), muscle pathology (H&E staining, fibrosis assessment, immunohistochemistry for dystrophin and associated proteins), serum biomarkers (creatine kinase, myoglobin), and cardiac assessment (echocardiography, ECG, hemodynamics).
Can muscular dystrophy models be used for gene therapy testing?
Yes. Muscular dystrophy models (particularly mdx and related models) are extensively used for testing gene therapy approaches including AAV-mediated dystrophin delivery, exon skipping strategies, and CRISPR-based correction. Models enable evaluation of therapeutic efficacy, safety, and long-term persistence.
What Cre drivers are used for muscle-specific studies?
Common muscle Cre drivers include MCK-Cre and HSA-Cre for skeletal muscle, alphaMHC-Cre for cardiac muscle, and MyoD-Cre for muscle progenitors. Tamoxifen-inducible Cre (CreER) enables temporal control for adult-onset studies. Selection depends on whether you're studying skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, or both.
