**Subject:** How Competitors Handle Project Timelines on Their Websites

## Executive Summary

**YES, we need to address timelines on our website.**

After researching 7 major competitors, **6 out of 7 publish specific timeline information** on their service pages. The one exception (genOway) explicitly states they discuss timelines during consultation—but still acknowledges the topic.

**However**, there's a strategic opportunity: Rather than publishing fixed timelines that become outdated as technology improves, we can position ourselves as the consultative choice while acknowledging the question customers have.

| ESC Targeting | 10 weeks |
| Chimera Generation | 12 weeks |
| F1 Heterozygous | 12 weeks |
| **Total (Traditional)** | **~54-70 weeks** |
| **ExpressMODEL® (Accelerated)** | **~42 weeks** |

**Their Approach:** Promotes "accelerated" timelines as a differentiator. Claims their ExpressMODEL® platform is "at least 3 months faster" than traditional approaches.

---

#### 3. **The Jackson Laboratory (JAX)**
**Source:** jax.org/jax-mice-and-services/custom-model-generation

| Deliverable | Timeline Published |
|-------------|-------------------|
| N1 Animals (backcrossed 1 generation) | **7-9 months** |

**Their Approach:** Single timeline range. Emphasizes free consultation with PhD scientists and "no-risk guarantee."

---

#### 4. **Applied StemCell**
**Source:** appliedstemcell.com/gene-editing-services

| Scenario | Timeline Published |
|----------|-------------------|
| Using their control/master cell lines | **6-8 weeks** |
| Using customer's cell line | **2-3 months** |

**Their Approach:** Very fast timelines (cell line focused, not full mouse generation). Uses speed as primary selling point.

---

#### 5. **Biocytogen**
**Source:** biocytogen.com/gene-editing-services

| Technology | Timeline Published |
|------------|-------------------|
| CRISPR/EGE™-based | **5-7 months** |
| ESC/HR-based | **7-11 months** |
| Conventional KO/KI (CRISPR) | **6-8 months** |
| Conventional KO/KI (ESC) | **9-12 months** |

**Their Approach:** Technology-based timeline differentiation. Promotes CRISPR as faster option.

---

### Competitors Who DON'T Publish Specific Timelines

#### 6. **genOway**
**Source:** genoway.com/product/customized

**Their Approach:** 
> "Timelines and budgets are considered during the design process based on target gene biology, model use, and technical feasibility."

**No specific timeline numbers published.** Instead, emphasizes consultation and custom approach.

## Key Insights

### What Customers Expect
- Timeline information is **standard in the industry**
- 6 of 7 major competitors provide timeline estimates
- Customers research and compare before contacting

### The Problem with Fixed Timelines
- Technology improves constantly (CRISPR efficiency, ES cell protocols)
- Timelines become outdated quickly
- Can become a liability if projects take longer
- Competitors may use outdated numbers against you

### The Opportunity
- Position as **consultative experts** who provide **accurate, project-specific timelines**
- Acknowledge the question while driving toward consultation
- Highlight that **technology advances** mean timelines improve regularly

## Recommended Website Text Alternatives

### Option A: Consultation-Forward (Recommended)

**For service pages:**

> **Project Timelines**
>
> Every custom mouse model project is unique, and timelines depend on factors including model complexity, strain background, and validation requirements.
>
> With continuous advances in gene editing technology, timeline estimates from even a few months ago may no longer reflect current capabilities. Our scientific team provides accurate, project-specific timelines during your complimentary consultation—ensuring you have realistic expectations based on the latest protocols.
>
> **[Schedule a Consultation →]**

---

### Option B: Range with Consultation CTA

**For service pages:**

> **How Long Does Model Generation Take?**
>
> Custom model generation timelines vary by project type and complexity. While industry timelines have historically ranged from 6-18 months depending on the approach, advances in gene editing technology continue to accelerate these timelines.
>
> Rather than publish estimates that may not reflect your specific project, we provide detailed timeline projections during your consultation—based on your gene of interest, desired modifications, and current protocol capabilities.
>
> **Contact us for an accurate timeline estimate for your project.**
>
> **[Request a Quote →]**

---

### Option C: FAQ Format

**For FAQ sections:**

> **Q: How long does a custom mouse model project take?**
>
> **A:** Project timelines depend on model type, complexity, and your specific requirements. With ongoing improvements in gene editing efficiency and ES cell targeting protocols, we've been able to reduce timelines compared to historical industry standards.
>
> The best way to get an accurate timeline is to speak with our scientific team. During your complimentary consultation, we'll review your project specifics and provide a detailed timeline based on our current capabilities.
>
> **[Schedule Your Consultation →]**

---

### Option D: Technology-Forward

**For technology or custom projects pages:**

> **Advancing Timelines Through Technology**
>
> Gene editing technology evolves rapidly. Protocols that took 12+ months just a few years ago can now be completed in significantly less time with improved CRISPR efficiency, optimized ES cell targeting, and streamlined validation approaches.
>
> Because technology continues to advance, we provide project-specific timeline estimates during consultation rather than publishing fixed numbers that may not reflect our current capabilities.
>
> **Get a current timeline estimate for your project:**
>

## Implementation Recommendations

### 1. **Add Timeline Content to Key Pages**
- Custom Projects page (already modified—may need timeline section)
- Knockout Models page
- Knockin Models page
- Conditional Knockout page
- Request Quote page (FAQ section)

### 2. **Suggested Messaging Themes**
- "Technology is always improving"
- "Project-specific accuracy over generic estimates"
- "Complimentary consultation for timeline planning"
- "Current capabilities, not outdated estimates"

### 3. **What NOT to Do**
- ❌ Don't ignore timelines entirely (customers expect this info)
- ❌ Don't publish fixed timelines that will become outdated
- ❌ Don't make claims that can be used against you if projects run long

### 4. **Competitive Positioning**
- "Unlike generic timeline estimates, we provide project-specific projections based on your exact requirements"
- "Our consultative approach ensures you get accurate expectations, not industry averages"
