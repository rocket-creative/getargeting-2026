## How It Works Section

**Section Title:** How the Breeding Scheme Architect Works

**Section Intro:**
Planning multi allele breeding schemes can be complex. This tool simplifies the process by automating Mendelian genetics calculations and identifying optimal breeding strategies.

### Step 1

**Title:** Define Your Alleles

**Description:**
Enter each allele you need to combine in your final model. Include knockouts, Cre drivers, reporters, or humanized alleles. Specify starting genotypes and chromosomal locations if known to help identify potential linkage issues.

### Step 2

**Title:** Set Target Genotypes

**Description:**
Define the experimental and control genotypes you need for your study. Specify how many mice of each genotype are required and any sex requirements. The tool accounts for Mendelian ratios when calculating breeding numbers.

### Step 3

**Title:** Generate Breeding Plan

**Description:**
The algorithm calculates the optimal sequence of crosses, identifies when to fix alleles to homozygosity, and maps the path from your starting strains to study ready cohorts. View expected offspring ratios at each generation.

### Step 4

**Title:** Export or Consult

**Description:**
Save your breeding plan as a PDF, share with collaborators, or request a consultation with our scientific team. We can help optimize your strategy, recommend Cre driver lines, or design custom models for your research.

## Why Use This Tool Section

**Section Title:** Why Researchers Use the Breeding Scheme Architect

### Benefit 1

**Title:** Visualize Complex Crosses

**Description:**
See your entire breeding strategy mapped out generation by generation. Understand which crosses to prioritize and when you can expect to have experimental cohorts ready.

### Benefit 2

**Title:** Optimize Resource Use

**Description:**
Calculate the number of breeding pairs and total mice needed to achieve your target sample sizes. Plan cage requirements and budget before starting.

### Benefit 3

**Title:** Avoid Common Mistakes

**Description:**
The tool warns about embryonic lethal genotype combinations, germline Cre activity issues, and potential linkage problems that could complicate your breeding scheme.

### Benefit 4

**Title:** Plan Before You Order

**Description:**
Use the breeding scheme architect before ordering custom models to understand post delivery breeding requirements and timeline to study ready cohorts.

## FAQ Section

**Section Title:** Frequently Asked Questions

### FAQ 1

**Question:** What breeding schemes can this tool plan?

**Answer:** The breeding scheme architect handles complex multi allele crosses including conditional knockouts with Cre lox systems, reporter alleles, humanized models, and combinations of up to six different alleles. It calculates optimal breeding paths, expected genotype ratios, and estimates time to experimental cohorts.

### FAQ 2

**Question:** How does the tool calculate breeding pair numbers?

**Answer:** The calculator uses established statistical methods similar to published research tools, accounting for Mendelian inheritance ratios, strain specific litter sizes (C57BL/6 averages 6 to 8 pups), breeding efficiency (approximately 80%), and your target sample size requirements.

### FAQ 3

**Question:** Can I save my breeding schemes?

**Answer:** Yes. Create a free account to save breeding schemes, export them as PDF documents, or generate shareable links for collaborators. Your saved schemes remain accessible for future reference and modification.

### FAQ 4

**Question:** What happens if my alleles are on the same chromosome?

**Answer:** The tool will alert you when alleles may be linked on the same chromosome, which affects recombination rates and inheritance patterns. In these cases, consult with our scientific team for guidance on optimal breeding strategies for linked alleles.

### FAQ 5

**Question:** How do I get help with my specific breeding project?

**Answer:** Request a project consultation to discuss your breeding scheme with our scientific team. We can help optimize your strategy, recommend appropriate Cre driver lines, and design custom models if needed. Consultation requests receive responses within one business day.
