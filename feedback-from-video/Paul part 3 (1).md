Curious so one thing I wanna show you in the therapeutic areas and this is probably for every top page that has two paragraphs. The font is different from paragraph one paragraph too so again just be consistent. Obviously this is a little bigger font little smaller font so again you just need to be consistent that let’s go to oncology oncology visual, and then technical considerations. We scroll down technical considerations. You need to get rid of this pre-jeremey you can keep the screwdriver in this thing but you get rid of the whole section or just get rid of the pre-Germline cardiovascular cardiovascular. You have the visual and again you just have to change the format in the testimonial immunology format. I mean the visual she probably gotta see for all of them but again go to technical considerations again pre-Germline remove that. OK that’s it for that one and then Alzheimer’s just a little weird. I don’t know what the hell we’re looking at and then auto immune diabetes and rare disease. Diabetes immune a testimonial changed format testimonial is fine. It’s just a format. I think that’s for that.
