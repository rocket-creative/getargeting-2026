  
Hi George, I am looking through the Jean Targeting website and, um, although we did edit a lot of these pages, I am looking at, um, the homepage just to making sure that you're actually seeing the homepage and not me.  
0:18  
I'm gonna have to work that out but let me just record for a little while and see. Um, so we went through this already but I'm just taking a quick look again.  
0:30  
I'm just going to click on Start Your Project to make sure, you know, obviously we need pictures and all of these squares for all of these pages even if they're just like, you know, generic, uh, mouse or whatever you choose.  
0:52  
Let's look at Request a Quote really quick here. Okay, this doesn't click. I understand you probably haven't linked it yet.  
1:01  
Um, talk to a scientist. Okay, that looks good. I'm just going down here for a second. Subscribe. Good. Umm, maybe because I'm on, um, loom, it scrolls a little, a little weird, but just looking to see what happens if we click, uh, download the pricing guide.  
2:30  
Oh, you've got to send a click. Put an email in, okay. Just looking to see what happens if we click on, Search catalog.  
2:54  
Just noticing here, um, you know, it says 20 plus disease areas. I don't know how we came up with that, but I imagine that there are probably more than 20 disease areas.  
3:10  
In that catalog. Okay, I'm just going to click on, request a catalog model. I'm just curious to know what that goes to.  
3:28  
Okay. So it says request catalog model. And then for this, I'm just wondering if we give them the option of just contacting us.  
3:48  
You know, we're making this a required field here on the, on the custom, on the catalog model form. But if they don't know, I mean, I guess that they could just type in anything.  
4:01  
But we may want to give them the option of just emailing us directly, like, at whatever our direct email addresses, which is like inquiry usually at genetargeting.com I'm noticing here on the catalog model page.  
4:21  
It says, how long does delivery take? Delivery time depends on current stock available. Yeah that's okay. Okay it does say here other ways to connect.  
4:44  
I would maybe just give them the option on these contact us pages, that if they don't want to fill out the form, which I know is ultimately what we want them to do, but if that deters them, I don't know if it's, if we have the option of just saying, you know, not ready to fill out the form yet, have  
5:02  
a general question contact us at inquiry at genetargeting.com. I'll leave that up to you to decide whether you think that's, um, whether you think that is, uh, reasonable or not.  
5:16  
Okay I'm gonna stop now and check this. Thank you.

Okay, I'm back. It looked like the first, uh, video recorded, so I am going back to, um, the gene targeting website, and I am back on the homepage again.  
0:13  
I clicked on these top buttons, Start Your Project, Schedule Consultation, and I sort of played through those and, um, made a few comments.  
0:21  
So now we're going down through, uh, the rest of the homepage just to be sure that all the, uh, all the edits were incorporated.  
0:31  
Let me just see here. One thing I had requested is in this preclinical services section, if you could put a dash between in vivo.  
0:42  
I don't know if that can happen, but there should be, like, a dash between in vivo here. I'm just looking through.  
0:53  
Um, it says for more than 30 years. Uh, this should change to for more than 25 years here in the Why Researchers Choose Ingenious Targeting Laboratory.  
1:17  
Okay, what we provide, I see that that has bullets now, that's really good. Really nice. Okay, I'm just looking through the conceptual workflow.  
1:43  
Um, I see that we're keeping the Breeding Scheme Architect on here for now.  
1:55  
Um, I'm, I'll just click through the button just to see, um, basically how it works. Sorry. And then, you see here on the Breeding Planning the Breeding Scheme for our triple transgenic mouse seemed overwhelming.  
2:45  
This tool helped us. I would almost change this to, if Michaela from InGenius, our company, tried this out, I would maybe put her name in here.  
2:57  
Michaela Ballas, comma, research scientist, uh, technology company, something like that, so it's not just, like, some random thing here. Okay, I'm just looking at the frequently asked questions because sometimes this section can be tricky.  
3:17  
Okay, let me see what it says about customer project consultation.  
3:41  
Okay, within one business day. That looks good. Okay, I'm going back to the home page again. I know that I keep clicking off of it, but, um, you know, another comment on the home page is to cool.  
4:00  
Yeah. Make this mouse at the top the image in a gloved hand. We've been talking about that. So before we go live, I'd really like to see that.  
4:09  
Okay, I'm just looking through frequently asked questions.  
4:53  
We went through all this before, so assuming that all of those changes from the documents were made. Just take a quick look.  
4:59  
Okay, so, if you make the minor changes that I suggested in this video, then I think the home page will home page is good, after those changes are made.  
5:25  
Thank you.  
Okay, I am back on the gene targeting site, and I am going to look through the custom models section, which I already provided a lot of edits for.  
00:12  
I think I have this video still in the background, so let me stop it. Okay. Okay, so let's just go to the main custom models section, and I see that You laid it out now in this menu, which is nice.  
00:32  
I'll double check that in a second. Let's just go to the main page here. We notice that the first little paragraph is, like, a little bit larger font than the second hero section paragraph.  
00:58  
We're not sure if that's on purpose. Let's look at explore model types really quickly. Okay, let me bring it to the knockout mouse page for this.  
01:12  
I'm just scrolling down a little bit to see. Okay, I'm not going to go through that In great depth right now.  
01:19  
Let's just go back to the custom models page. I read through this all originally, as long as the edits were made from my documents.  
01:36  
Okay, the only way to know, I think that on this page, if I remember, I don't know if these are I think that I commented that, uh, there's only one way for me to know and that would be I would have to go back to the final doc and look at the custom model page.  
02:38  
I'm almost certain that that's not our action. Actual publications, hold on. Let's just go look quick here. If I have it.  
02:47  
Here. Yeah, this is loom. It scrolls a little funny. I've got to stop it. Hold on. I'd rather not have, uhm, I'd rather not have not our publications on the page, like, no publications on the page, than have publications that aren't ours on the page.  
03:14  
But I'm pretty sure that for all these pages, I gave publications that can be used, so let me just, Look really quickly here.  
03:26  
Okay. Let me just see here. Okay, it looks like I removed them because they weren't ours. I don't know if you want to say, you can't say that they're from Ingenious Targeting Laboratory if you want to keep these on the page.  
03:47  
You're just going to have to say custom mouse models removed from Ingenious Targeting Laboratory. See, it's tricky because you can't say have contributed.  
04:00  
To 800 peer-reviewed publications. I would say either remove this completely or make this generic. Here are some custom mouse model publications for you to review or something.  
04:13  
It can't be tied to our company because they're not our publications. Okay, frequently asked questions. How long does it take to generate a custom mouse model?  
04:33  
I think we made this more generic and then I think it's okay. I think that that's fine.  
05:08  
So I think the main custom model page, if you make that, those couple of changes or that, especially that change to the publication section, I think it's fine.  
05:18  
Now I did go through, uhm, most of these pages, so I'm not gonna go back through, uhm, ones that I've already gone through and gave you edits for in the Google Sheets.  
05:31  
I'm only gonna just continue on to pages that I haven't gone through yet. Uhm, but now that they're reordered, I've gotta figure out what pages those are.  
05:38  
So, uhm, let me just look at how they're ordered here though. Okay that looks good. That's good. Okay so the way the milk menu is ordered is good.  
06:04  
I just have to remember now, I'm gonna have to go back to, uhm, what I finished to figure out where I left off.  
06:13  
Hold on. I mean, I know one place that I left off was this tag knock-in. Nice, potentially, so let me go to that.  
06:28  
Let me just see if that's one of them here. Okay I'm going to look through the tag knockin mice page.  
06:40  
Oh, I see, uhm, so this image here is our split GFP image and I don't think that that can be used for this page.  
06:55  
I don't know how, like, the images from our old website got populated onto our new website, but let me just take a look at something then.  
07:04  
Hold on, let me look at knockout. Okay, I think this is accurate scientifically, but I do want to talk to Paul about page images.  
07:20  
Alright, it's accurate.  
07:44  
Let's put it that way. Uhm, it's accurate enough, at least. Let me look at conventional for a second. Okay, there's no image here.  
07:52  
Just be aware that on some of these pages we don't have any images. I think that on our old website we did have an image for that the condition page is correct, it's just that it's definitely ESL approach, uh, image here.  
08:18  
Tissue-specific we don't have anything. Inducible we don't have anything. Okay. Uhm, so back to tag, knock-in. I do not think we can use this image up here, so I would probably replace it with, if we don't have something than just something generic or no image at all.  
08:38  
If I use tag, knock-ins, I, I read through all of this in the original, uhm, in the original docs and I'm not gonna read through all of it again, I, these were all accurate enough.  
09:08  
I'm just curious if you click, like, learn more, where does it go? Oh, it goes to a flagged-up page, okay.  
09:15  
Does the same thing happen if you do a JDAG? I'm pretty sure I read through all these, too, so, So, uhm, I'm gonna assume that all of those are, are okay.  
09:28  
Tag placement. Applications of tags. Design considerations, I believe I read through this. Okay, selected publications. may be accurate.  
09:51  
I think that I developed these, so I am just going to double check really quickly, but I am pretty sure that I did.  
10:00  
give you the correct publications for that section, so let me just see here. I actually don't think so. Okay, so the publications on this page are not correct, and if you go back to the original Google Doc, in the final folder, there is a section in there where I have the correct publications.  
10:59  
It's the publications that begin with the last names. Tebi is the first one, Rumni is the second, Samant is the third.  
11:10  
So that has to be edited for this page. Okay, Frequently Asked Questions, I think I looked through all this and it was fine.  
11:32  
I'm almost positive, I just recently read through all this. Yeah. Okay, other than those, um, minor changes, this page is done.  
11:48  
So I am going to move on to now, I've got to look to see where I left off, hold on.  
11:53  
Oh, I did tag already, um, or I was working on it.  
12:05  
Okay, um, like I said, I'm not going to go through all of those that I already made all those edits on.  
12:13  
Did I do inducible conditional? I don't think, oh yeah, I did. Okay, so I'm not going to go back to that again, I already gave you those edits.  
12:20  
Let's look at, I don't think I did cDNA knock-in. Okay, I'm going to look at the cDNA knock-in page. This one I have to look at a little more carefully because I haven't looked through this one yet, so again, um, either remove this box at the top, um, we might have, uh, images on our old site, but if  
12:50  
we want to go live quick, just, I would either remove this box at the top or we need to talk about what an appropriate image would be for this page.  
12:57  
I do remember, we, we went through this, um, in, in a, originally in a, in the first round, so I'm not going to read through all of this, like, word for word here, I remember that we thought all of this sounded pretty good.  
13:40  
This is fine to go live, but I'm making a note that, um, we do have to have a discussion as a company about these conditional approaches, like these conditional cDNAs and these conditional knock-ins, we do have to have a discussion about this because I think that they can be described a little bit better  
14:39  
, we're missing, um, a certain type of conditional knock-in, which is what's called an inversion approach, I don't know if you can use AI to come up with language for what an inversion approach would be for these conditional knock-in and these, like, conditional cDNA projects, but this is some language  
14:59  
that we have to get onto this page eventually. I wouldn't necessarily do it right now but it's okay for right now but that is something that we do have to add like once the page goes live.  
15:39  
Okay, Okay, this is okay.  
15:51  
Here, what about this?  
16:05  
What size cDNA can be knocked in?  
16:30  
Eh, I think it's okay because it's just a contact us if it's larger sizes.  
16:41  
Okay, I think that this page, other than those edits, um, I said are fine.  
17:00  
There's not a publication section on this page? We have a lot of cDNA knock-in projects that we've completed, so we could theoretically eventually add a publication section to this page.  
17:14  
It doesn't have to be right now, um, but just in general. Okay, I did pull it point mutation. I don't think I did reporter, I'm pretty sure.  
17:24  
Oh, I did do reporter. Okay, so I'm not going to do that. Tag we just did conditional knock-in. Did I do conditional knock-in?  
17:38  
No. So let's do conditional knock-in. Okay, same comment on the top. We probably We just have to remove this image box.  
17:58  
And I'm just reading here because, all right, the same thing with this one.  
18:41  
only talks about one way of making a conditional knock-in, and there are other ways, and this one way that we're talking about is, it is one way, but we're missing, like, another critical way called, like, an inversion approach with LOXP sites.  
18:56  
I don't know if we can look that up and get the AI to come up with some language for that, but to go live with the site, it's okay to just leave it as-is.  
19:05  
I'm just reading through.  
19:48  
This'll be interesting. Design considerations. Okay, it just talks about using specific trees, that's fine. We have a test site. Testimonial that's actually ours.  
20:02  
Okay, that's alright. Okay, what is involved in generating a conditional knock-in model?  
20:37  
And then it just says here, custom model, generation timeline, is very based on project complexity and specific. Contact us for a detailed timeline.  
20:45  
Estimate tailored to your conditional knock-in project. I guess that's okay. Okay. Alright, other than those minor things I mentioned, um, this page is fine.  
21:11  
So, let me go to humanized models, which I do not think. Oh, okay, um, I did do humanized mouse models already.  
21:18  
I'm not going to do that one. Let's see, I don't think I did gene replacement. Okay, so I'm going to look through the gene replacement page under the custom models section.  
21:41  
That looks good. What is this? Oh, all humanized models. If you click on that. Hm, it's a little, uh, deceiving because it brings you to a, it just brings you to this humanized mouse models page, but I mean, our humanized mouse models are customized, custom, so I don't know how accurate it is, but I  
22:27  
that for the purpose of going live it's okay. It just suggests that you're going to bring them to a page where you're going to, um, where you're going to talk about, like, a catalog of humanized mouse models available, and that's not really the page that it goes to.  
22:50  
So I have to go back. I remember going through these in the original Okay, so let's look at gene replacement targeting strategy really quickly.  
23:27  
Okay, it's a minor thing, but on this, in this receptor humanization section, if you could put a dash between G and protein, so it should be D, G-protein, G-protein coupled receptors, there should be a dash in there.  
24:21  
Okay, I think that's a right.  
24:51  
We have the testimonials, they're ours. Okay, so, um, I believe that I chose these publications for this page for just general humanized models, but let me just double check.  
25:11  
This is the gene replacement page, so let me just double check. I'm just looking at these frequently asked questions.  
26:11  
They look fine. Okay, so other than those things that I mentioned that need review, um, this page is done. Let's look at transgenic mouse service under the custom models section.  
26:40  
Hmm, that's a interesting. So when we go to the transgenic mouse section, it brings you back to the custom models main page.  
26:53  
So, for instance, let me just go back here. So this is the custom models main page. Then, if you go in this menu to transgenic mouse service, is it exactly the same?  
27:12  
No, it's not the same. But why is this one at the top called Custom Mouse Models? Let me look at something here.  
27:22  
I don't remember going through this. Hmm. So this is actually a page that I don't think we went through in the original.  
27:48  
Oh, I'm sorry. Yes, we did. Here it is. Alphabetical order. Okay, so you can see here that this is not linked properly, so this is there is a page that should be named, like, Transgenic Mouse Models somewhere.  
28:09  
This, this is the final doc, so you can see. Micarosa 26 Safe Harbor. Okay, so let's just go back here and see what this one says again.  
28:29  
OK, so for this one, this is the transgenic mouse service page. This needs to be. Linked to the correct page, then I'll have to review maybe one more time, but I would not necessarily not make the site live.  
29:05  
I just want to make sure that it links to the correct page. OK, so now we're going to move on to rat models.  
29:13  
Again, we have to do something with this image up here. Maybe just remove it if you don't have like this image block.  
29:19  
Just remove it if you don't have something. Let me go to, I don't think that this page was reviewed originally.  
30:01  
Because I don't know if we can do all these types of rat models. I have to actually go to our old site for a second.  
30:08  
So this is our old site, but let me look. And what we say we can do here, It's been a while.  
30:20  
I'm sure it probably says, Oh, it does say it. Okay. What types of rat are possible? So we can do conditionals, reporter genes, reporter knock-ins, and human cDNAs.  
30:34  
Okay, so let me go back to the RAT page here. This is this new site RAT page. Conventional, conditional, reporter, humanized.  
30:52  
Okay. That's actually accurate then. Types of rat models available. Conventional, knock-in, conditional, point mutation reporter gene knock-in looks good okay The available strains.  
31:24  
Let me just go back to our old site and make sure that we can offer all four of those. I'm pretty sure we can.  
31:32  
Yes, we can. The only inbred is the Lewis. It is. That's accurate. What is this? Looking for detailed technical information for your comprehensive.  
32:00  
Oh, legacy data. Document. Does this bring us to the original page? Oh, CRISPR rat. Okay. For the, the legacy page that you click to from the rat model page on the new site, I would just remove this word CRISPR on the legacy page.  
32:38  
That's it. I would just remove that word CRISPR in the title. Title here, CRISPR rat models for genetic research. Just remove the word CRISPR and just say rat models for genetic research.  
32:48  
And I wanted to see where else does it say it? That's it. So I would remove that. I'm going back to the main rat models page, going back down to that link for the legacy section.  
33:08  
All right, so then it's download the RAC guide, which we haven't looked at these guides in a long time.  
33:23  
I'm just going to assume that they're okay. And then there's a white paper here, which also requires a download. So that's fine.  
33:36  
Um, we, we should really review our downloadables at some point, but for the sake of, um, going live, if you make that minor change to that like legacy page I think that this page is fine.  
33:54  
Okay I'm going to knock out rat models now. Okay, this needs to change because we have not completed hundreds of knockout rat models.  
34:12  
I would just say, since 1998, Engineering Starting Laboratory has completed over 2,500 gene targeting projects across multiple species, including rat, comma, enabling loss of function studies in larger rodents offering superior behavior characterization and physiological readout capacity.  
34:38  
So I'm going to read it again. We're going to edit this to since 1998 in January. Engineering Starting Laboratory has completed over 2,500 gene targeting projects across multiple species, comma, including rat.  
34:51  
Rats. Let's make it rats. Including rats. No. I'm wrong. It should be rat. So let me read it one more time.  
34:59  
Since 1998, Engineering Starting Laboratory has completed over 2,500 gene targeting projects across multiple species, including rat, comma, enabling loss of function studies in larger rodents, offering superior behavioral characterization and physiological readout capacity.  
35:19  
Let me know if you have any questions about that edit. Okay? I don't love that, the tradeoff between increased project timeline and cost against, uhm, superior phenotypic rediastomase knockout rats optimal.  
36:08  
We can leave it for now. Mutations in multiple genes. Yes, multi-pluxed CRISPR approaches targeting several genes simultaneously are feasible in rats.  
36:49  
We should change this. I would just say yes, multiple mutations in several genes are feasible in rats, though knockout efficiency typically decreases with increased target number.  
37:20  
you And then I would just completely remove the line sequential CRISPR editing with selection of appropriate edited embryos enables more complex genetic combinations.  
37:45  
I would remove that sentence completely. Okay, now this question, how do I establish multiple genes? Multiple knockout rat lines for validation.  
38:04  
CRISPR injection of multiple founders typically generates diverse indel mutations at the same targeting locus. I would actually just remove this question completely.  
38:19  
It's too complicated to have to edit. Uhm, I would just remove it completely. So how do I establish multiple knockout rat lines for validation?  
38:27  
Remove of that frequently asked question completely. And then the last question is fine. Okay.  
38:52  
I'm going to move on to the knock-in rat models page. Knock-in rat models. Gotta do something about that image block.  
39:07  
Okay, we have to change this again too. Since 1998, Ingenious Targeting Laboratory has completed over 2,500 custom mouse and rat models.  
39:19  
remove with hundreds of knockout rat projects, and keep enabling precise insertion of human disease mutations, reporter genes, and functional variants in larger rodents providing superior translational relevance.  
39:37  
All right, let me read what this sentence is going to say. Since 1998, Ingenious Targeting Laboratory has completed over 2,500 custom mouse and rat models, comma, enabling precise insertion of human disease mutations, reporter genes, and functional variants in rodents providing superior translational  
39:58  
relevance. Okay, the rest of that is alright.  
40:41  
Alright, the rest of that is okay. Let's go to the Frequently Asked Questions section. First question is okay. Second question I would remove completely.  
41:10  
What is the maximum size insert for knock-in wrap models? I would just completely remove that because it talks about CRISPR and sizing and it's just, you know, it's going to be too big of an edit.  
41:24  
So I would just remove that question. So what is the maximum size insert for knock-in wrap models? Remove that completely.  
41:30  
Question three Validated through rapid back-crossing crosses. Please remove the last sentence here. This approach typically requires 12 to 16 weeks to establish foundational lines.  
42:15  
Just remove that last sentence that has timeline in it. Okay, moving on now to custom rabbit models. Is a rabbit not a rodent?  
42:48  
Gotta look this up. Okay, they're not rodents.  
43:31  
So the first paragraph is accurate. What does contact us to discuss? So, okay, it's just the quote page, the contact us page.  
43:41  
All right, that's fine. Rabbit model applications. Rabbits offer unique advantages for certain research applications compared to rodent models. That's fine.  
43:54  
Custom project consultation. Huh. We don't talk about, uhm, what we can do.  
44:11  
It's just very generic. It's fine. All right, I'm going to go to now, uh, okay, so now there is another section for custom animal models.  
44:22  
Hmm, I don't think we do transgenic rat.  
44:48  
Rat models, custom knockout and knock-in rat models. That should be an edit. It's a minor thing, but under the rat model section here, custom knockout and knock-in rat models, I would take out the transgenic part.  
45:10  
Rabbit is good. Okay, it's technically targeted transgenic. So, mouse models, our core expertise in custom mouse model generation spans knockout, knock-in, humanized, and targeted transgenic approaches with over 2,500 completed projects since 1998\.  
45:36  
That's fine. I would just add the word targeted before the word transgenic, so I'm going to read it one more time.  
45:42  
Under the mouse models block here, it's going to be our core expertise in custom mouse model generation spans knockout, knock-in, humanized, and targeted transgenic approaches with over 2,500 completed projects since 1998\.  
46:41  
Modifications for rat models. Available modifications for other species depend on current technology capabilities and region availability. Contact us for specific inquiries.  
46:54  
Okay, so that first sentence is going to change to we offer knockout, knock-in, and transgenic. Sorry, one more time. We offer knockout, knock-in, and targeted transgenic modifications for rat models.  
47:06  
Everything else can stay the same, and the rest of the page is fine. So if you make those edits, the color custom models section will be complete.  
47:27  
Thank you so much.

Okay, I am doing the technology section of the gene targeting website. Okay, so technology overview page.  
00:15  
Sorry, just making sure I'm on the right page. Technology overview. Okay, Ingenious Targeting Laboratory has refined gene targeting technologies through more than 2,500 custom projects.  
00:32  
Alright, this needs to be edited because I don't want to, uhm, include ES cells.  
00:52  
So our methodology combines proven technologies with sophisticated allele design strategies to deliver mouse models with verified genetic modifications and predictable performance.  
01:04  
So I'm going to read that again. We're going to edit this to take out the word ES cell gene targeting.  
01:09  
Okay? Our methodologies combine proven technologies with sophisticated allele design strategies to deliver mouse models. With verified genetic modifications and predictable performance.  
01:23  
I'm just noticing here that we're saying 26 plus years experience, so if we're going to do 26 plus years experience, we need to just make sure that that is across the entire website.  
02:23  
So whenever it says, like, over however many years of experience on the site, we should make a script or whatever where it says over 26 years experience, if that's the number we're going to use.  
02:39  
Okay, bye. Mm, Core Technologies, this whole section should just be removed. We don't want to bring attention to ESL targeting, using homologous or combination.  
02:53  
That's screams ESL, so I would just remove this entire section, Core Technologies. This Conditional System section is fine.  
03:30  
Oof, this Derivative Allele. I would also just remove completely this Derivative Allele System section, because this is not our technology.  
03:39  
This is some other company's technology with these TMLA and TMLB or whatever this is. Just remove this completely, Derivative Allele System section.  
03:50  
Testimonial is fine.  
04:12  
Start your project is fine. Okay, in the Frequently Asked Questions section, just completely remove what are derivative alleles and how are they generated.  
05:01  
And then this page is fine to go live right now, but we really need to beef up this page a little bit with, you know, what we can do.  
05:08  
It's just, it's very generic, it's almost not even worth keeping, but if you make those edits, at least it will not say anything that would deter people from wanting to use us.  
05:20  
Okay, Craylox system. I feel like I went through this, like, over and over and over and over again, probably, but.  
05:49  
This image, I'm just getting a little tripped up on this image because technically it uses the Craylox system to achieve this design here, but it's not, like, classic.  
05:56  
It's actually, it's interesting. It's actually interesting to use this. This, um, I think it's okay, but it is not, it's hard to explain, without, you know, putting the science into it, but I guess it's okay.  
06:13  
I guess it's okay. But I'm going to just write a note that this is the Cree LOCKS system page under technology review image.  
06:32  
For now it's okay in order to go live. Okay, so this sentence here.  
06:49  
Our Cree LOCKS-based models have supported research published in more than 800 peer-reviewed journals, including Science, Nature, and Cell, there needs to be an and there, including Science, Nature, and Cell, comma, enabling tissue-specific and temporally controlled gene manipulation across every organ  
07:11  
system. you Okay, the rest of that hero section is fine.  
08:00  
Cree LOCKS works. I remember going through this, like, over and over again in the first rendition, so I'm not going to go back through all of this.  
08:40  
I remember going through this. This is fine. You know, view all Cree drivers and Cree line selection guide. I think I might have gone through that, but, oops, I'm sorry.  
08:56  
We'll get, we'll get to that when we get to that page, okay. Um, I'm not going to click through right now.  
09:12  
All right, Inducible Systems. I mean, And I think that we said that it was okay to keep doxycycline as long as we don't say we do it.  
09:26  
So let's just look here. Um, this derivative alleles, I edited this so that it was not the technology from the other company, but just the general design idea of this.  
09:38  
So I think it's probably okay. Let me just read it. It's okay. I edited it so that it wasn't specific to the other company and it could be applied to like anybody who wanted who can use it.  
10:09  
Selected publications, um, odds are I chose ours, but let me just be sure. Hold on. Let's get rid of some of these other ones here because we are getting really Busy here.  
10:33  
Alright, let me, um, go to, It's Creelocks. I think it's, is it Creelocks System?  
10:49  
I can't remember what this is. Yes, okay. Let's just make sure these publications at the bottom are ours, and then I'm pretty certain this page will be done.  
11:00  
Annoying, something up. Milk. Oh, I see Wang. Mmm, okay. So these publications are not correct.  
11:38  
These were the publications that I selected for this page, okay? Um, you gotta go back to the final doc, the Creelock system in the final folder and replace the the publications that are on this page currently with those three publications there.  
11:56  
So this is the CRELOC system need to replace. Publications at the bottom. Okay. Okay, what researchers say is fine. Recommend optional logs, pleat positioning, that's fine.  
12:30  
And then we have some guides here. Creelock's design guide is going to be a downloadable. Cree repositories, let me just see.  
12:39  
you and the breeding scheme architect. I'm just gonna click through and look at what this is. Oh, this is an old downloadable of ours.  
12:49  
Okay, it's probably, it's probably okay. Okay, this is fine. Yes, this is fine down here. Okay, so this page is, I'm just looking at these links really quick.  
13:41  
This page is fine if those edits are made. Okay, um, I'm moving on to the FlipFRT system and I would say the first thing is to remove this.  
13:54  
I would remove this image just because this is an ESL approach, and I'd rather have no image here at all than have this image.  
14:04  
So please remove this image on the FlipFRT system page and then I'm gonna have to read through to see if we can even keep Okay, let's see if we can make an edit to this.  
14:30  
I may decide to just remove this page completely, but let's see if we can make an edit to this. Since 1998 and FRT recombination system in hundreds of gene targeting projects providing researchers with versatile tools for conditional gene expression and sophisticated allele conversion strategies.  
14:57  
So you're just gonna remove for selection cassette removal. Okay, I'm gonna read it one more time. Since 1998 and The Genes Targeting Laboratory has utilized the FLIP.  
15:08  
FRT recombination system and hundreds of gene targeting projects providing researchers with versatile tools for conditional gene expression and sophisticated allele conversion strategies.  
15:21  
The rest of it is fine if you make that edit there.  
15:33  
Okay. Applications for FLIP FRT system. Completely remove the selection cassette removal section.  
15:47  
Just get rid of it. Remove the derivative allele just because it's complex to edit without going into a document. you You can keep dual recombinase strategies.  
16:09  
And you can keep gene expression control. The comparison chart is fine. The variants and driver lines are fine. The quote is fine.  
16:37  
Start your FlipFRT project is fine.  
16:49  
Okay, frequently asked questions. Uhm, I would remove the first question completely.  
16:59  
When should I use FlipFRT instead of CreLox? It's just too complicated. It talks about selection cassette removal. It's just, let's just remove it.  
17:14  
Second question is fine. Third question is okay.  
17:32  
And the fourth question is okay. So I would just remove that first question.  
17:42  
When should I use FlipFRT instead of CreLox? Just remove it. Okay, I am moving on to Rosa26Targeting.  
18:24  
Oh boy. Let's look at this. Hmm, the image I think is okay, actually. Yes, the image is okay. It's interesting because we're using, um, we're kind of like using a different technology on this page, but let's just see how it reads.  
19:00  
Okay, there's no, this is not like a rapid Rosa26Targeting, really, but let's just, let's just leave it on this page, as is, like that.  
19:13  
Why target the Rosa26Locus? That's fine. you Hmm, okay, Rosa26MouseModelTypes, this block here, ConditionalExpression, InducibleExpressionWithCreeOrTetSystems, I would change this to InducibleExpressionWithCreeOrOtherSystems.  
20:01  
gonna change to ConditionalExpression, InducibleExpressionWithCreeOrOtherSystems. What is the Rosa26Locus? That's fine. Hmm.  
20:31  
Start your Rosa26 project. Are scientific consultants ready to discuss your transgenic requirements? Because it can mean different things.  
20:41  
Can we change this to, Are scientific consultants ready to discuss your targeted transgenic requirements and determine the optimal targeting strategy for your research goals?  
20:54  
If you don't want to say targeting twice, you can write it like this. Are scientific consultants ready to discuss your targeted transgenic requirements and determine the optimal strategy for your research goals?  
21:09  
All right, I'm always curious about this. Legacy page, so let's just click through for a second and look for the legacy information.  
21:26  
Okay, I mean, I'm not, I'm not looking through it, like, word for word, but it looks okay.  
21:48  
Okay, and then the downloadable resources, so other than that, this page is good. So, let's go to inducible gene expression.  
21:59  
Image block. Something has to happen with that. Okay, the hero section is fine. The why inducible control matters is fine.  
22:35  
Okay, major inducible systems, let me look at this. Alright, the Cree ER T2 is fine.  
22:55  
Okay. I think it's okay to keep the FAST technology on this page.  
23:25  
We can keep it. This is a question I have to ask Paul. But I'm pretty certain we can keep it.  
23:41  
Let's keep it for now. Okay, uhm, this can be a little tricky. Choosing an inducible system. Um, I guess it's fine to talk about doxycycline and Ted, as long as we don't say, we use it.  
24:03  
That's pretty much what Paul had said to me. So, I guess it's okay to keep that for now, but let's just see what it says down here as far as what we can do.  
24:15  
I'm just writing this down, um, because, I just want to see if we said that this page should be deleted completely.  
25:00  
We did have, like, some pages that we wanted deleted completely, and I don't know if this was one of them, so let me just check.  
25:07  
Okay, it doesn't look like we said to delete Is that what this one is?  
25:43  
Some of them have different, Yes, okay. So we didn't say to remove this, so I would say just those minor edits that I suggested, and I'm going to talk to Paul about whether anything else has to change on this page, but to go live, just those minor things that I mentioned for this page.  
26:01  
Okay, moving on to back-to-back large-scale targeting, which, I don't know if you'd notice that, but when I, uhm, oh, it's a 404 page error.  
26:24  
Okay, so that needs to be fixed. Okay, uhm, just refresh. I hope I don't lose you by refreshing this. No, okay, uhm, let's go back.  
26:33  
So under technology, and do you see how it kind of, like, hangs over the, uhm, that like block there anyway Uhm, back-to-back large-scale targeting is a 404 error.  
26:50  
Okay, let's look at Cree line selection guide. I think I looked at this originally and I thought it was really cool.  
26:56  
Choose the right Cree driver line. Choosing the right Cree driver line. This guy covers selection criteria. Okay. I think all this is fine.  
27:44  
Okay.  
27:54  
I don't know if this is, uh, actually completely true. Need help selecting a Cree line? I don't know if we'll help them do that, but just for the sake of going live, let's just, let's just keep that for now and it's one of those things where I'll just, I'll have to ask Paul.  
28:12  
So this is the Cree Cree line selection guide, need help, selecting a Cree line, ask Paul. So for the sake of going live, keep it, I'll ask him.  
28:34  
I mean, this is very buried, people are going to have to really hunt for this, so, okay. Anyway, so let's just see, how do I choose this one?  
28:41  
Sourcetree, that's fine, okay, these are fine. So that whole section is okay. I believe that we, all right, so here, I'm in the links down here, I believe that the Doxycycline Inducible Systems, is this going to lead to a page?  
29:13  
Oh no, it's a 404, so I think, I think we said that we wanted that removed, And that's probably why it's leading to a 4 of 4\.  
29:21  
And that link just hasn't been removed, uh, from it. Yeah, this Doxycycline Inducible Systems, we want that removed, and, again, you, you, you probably removed it, and that's why it's leading to a 4 of 4\.  
29:42  
But the link just needs to be removed there. Okay, Conditional versus Conventional Guide, you see how it hangs over the edge here?  
29:49  
I don't know if there's I'm having with that, but I'm noticing it. Okay, this is fine.  
30:09  
I remember going through this, I think this is just very basic. We went through all this when we were doing the Google Docs.  
30:21  
Decision Scenarios, what is this? This is interesting. I think I would read through this, but, Knockout first. Conditional ready. Okay.  
31:41  
Hmmmm. Alright, this actually needs a small edit. So, allele types generated. Knockout first. Functions is null. Potentially with Laxey reporter, that's fine.  
31:55  
Conditional ready. Flip excision creates floxed allele. Conditional not ready. Conditional null. Create excision of target, targeted exon.  
32:07  
Of target exon. So this needs to be changed to conditional null, in parentheses, create excision of target exon. And then we can keep this section.  
32:22  
So, we are in, what are we in here? We are in, conditional versus Conventional, Edit, To, Derivative, Boleal, Section.  
32:41  
Okay, so if you make this edit, conditional null, create excision of target exon, then it's accurate. However, if you click, you shouldn't get a page for this.  
33:05  
You know what? It's fine. Just let them contact us. It'll lead to a page and if they get confused, they'll just contact us.  
33:12  
That's fine. Contact us.  
33:29  
Alright, let's look at these FAQs.  
33:42  
Okay. Looking at these links down here.  
34:11  
This. ESL gene targeting is probably going to lead to a 404\. The page should have been deleted. It does. So, we just need to remove that link.  
34:23  
Okay. Critical exon selection page. Image block. Something has to be done with that. What is What is this? Since 1998, an engineering laboratory has analyzed exon structure and identified critical exons for over 470\.  
34:43  
I have no idea where those numbers came from. I don't know if they're accurate at all.  
34:59  
So, I would change this sentence here just to, like, our general, like, what we generally say. Engineering targeting laboratory, you know, whatever.  
35:08  
Go back to, like, our general, you know, here, custom, no, no, no, like some generic something here like this. Has completed over however many projects, uhm, our mouse models have supported research in 800 peer-reviewed articles including Science, Nature, and Cell.  
35:34  
I would keep it very generic. I wouldn't be specific like that. So, I would go back to, like, the description for the custom models page, but I would, or the knockout page, but I would just have this be put on the critical exon page.  
36:01  
Since 1998, Genius Targeting Laboratory has completed over 2,500 custom gene targeting projects for researchers at universities, pharmaceutical companies, and research institutes institutions worldwide.  
36:12  
Our mouse models have supported research published in more than 800 peer-reviewed articles including Science, Nature, and Cell. That's what I would use on as the first paragraph on this critical exon selection page.  
36:25  
Now let me look for the second paragraph here. I think that's fine. I think it's fine if you, if you leave it like that.  
36:44  
It may need, like, a minor edit once it's live, but as long as we get rid of this, like, very specific information here that I don't know if it's true in it.  
36:52  
Also, the numbers are a little low. I mean, if we have over 2,500 publications, like, I mean, sorry, 2,500 models completed, I don't know, there should be more than 156 peer-reviewed articles for this, so it just doesn't make sense to me.  
37:10  
Okay. Critical, axon, selection. And we'll just keep that last sentence, which now doesn't make 100% sense, but it's not bad.  
37:33  
Oh, and here, we have it here, 470 genes analyzed, 156 publications. I would, I would just make that whatever our normal numbers are.  
37:41  
I wouldn't make it specific. I think that's fine. This section, I'm going to assume that's correct.  
38:22  
I used to do that, but it's been a while, but I think that is correct. Okay, early exons are excellent targets because deleting exon 1 guarantees loss of function in every transcript.  
38:50  
You can't guarantee anything with mouse models. You have no idea what's going to happen if the mouse model's never been made.  
38:56  
Early exons are excellent targets because deleting exon 1 can cause loss of function in every transcript variant produced from that gene.  
39:09  
So, this needs to be an edit on this page, never saying guaranteeing anything, any outcome when it comes to making these models.  
39:18  
Okay, so, under this, targeting early exons, are excellent targets because deleting exon 1 can cause loss of function in every transcript variant produced from that gene.  
39:55  
Just because it can doesn't mean it will. Okay. Okay, I think it's, uh, it's still risky language, but if you just change that to can cause instead of guarantees loss, guarantees loss of function.  
40:26  
So early exons are excellent targets because deleting exon 1 can cause loss of function in every transcript variant produced from that gene.  
40:36  
It kind of safeguards us more. Hmm.  
41:30  
Urgh. Some of this language is so tricky. Okay, Functional Domain Mapping. Integrate structural domain information with exon locations, targeting exons, encoding critical domains for, I've got to be really careful how you say these things here because it suggests that we're going to guarantee an outcome  
41:59  
and we can't. Let me think about this for a second. This one's wrong too. Guarantees. You can't. I would almost say completely remove this section might be easier.  
42:29  
Okay. I think that for now, because it's just too tricky, this needs a major edit and this is not completely true and we're using the word guarantee in here again, I would just completely remove our exon selection of the approach.  
42:43  
This would require a bigger edit that is hard for me to do like on video. So I would say just remove it for now.  
43:01  
Selected publications. Again, I have a feeling that these are not ours. We tend to use this one and plus look how old it is.  
43:11  
1999\. Yikes. We can find better publications for this page. I would say maybe use the publications from the conditional not.  
43:21  
Knockout page. So, and I don't know if they're actually accurate on that page. I may have told you when I did that page that it had to be taken off of the, uhm, the Google Docs.  
43:34  
So for this section here, Selected Publications and Exxon Selection, use the publications from our conditional knockout page. as long as they're the ones off of the final doc that we created for that page.  
43:52  
Okay, Exxon Analysis, yikes.  
44:07  
Critical Exxon is foundational. Okay, this needs an edit too because we're being too bold here. Start your Exxon Analysis. Can we just change this to start your project or something?  
44:33  
Just start your mouse model project. Critical Exxon Selection is the foundation of successful knockout design. Our team can help you analyze your turn.  
44:41  
Target Genes, Exxon Structure, Identify Optimal Exxons for Targeting. Okay, this is how it's going to read. Critical Exxon Selection is the foundation of successful knockout design.  
44:56  
Our team can help you analyze your target genes, Exxon Structure, and Identify Optimal Exxons for Targeting, period. Okay. Let's look at these frequently asked questions.  
45:41  
I don't know why they say Exxon 1 is highly efficient but difficult for conditional targeting. Maybe because it's too close to the promoter.  
45:51  
I would maybe remove that completely. Let's remove this sentence. Exxon 1 is highly efficient but difficult for conditional targeting. I would remove the last two sentences completely.  
46:15  
Exxon 1 is highly efficient but difficult for conditional targeting. We perform comprehensive Exxon analysis including all isoforms, domain mapping, and tissue-specific expression.  
46:25  
Just remove those last two sentences completely from this question. Okay, that one's fine.  
46:54  
That's fine. Uh, here. Guarantees. You cannot say that. Alright, let's remove this question.  
47:34  
It's just too hard of an edit for me to make on a video. What is the difference between targeting a single exon versus multiple?  
47:44  
Remove it. Completely. Okay? Okay, and that last question is fine.  
48:18  
Down here, um, this should actually be removed, hopefully. Related Technologies, TM1A. Ugh, okay, this has to be removed. So this TM1A link has to be removed and the click-through page that it links to has to be removed.  
48:35  
It's not our technology. TM1A allele design. Remove link and page that it clicks to.  
48:53  
And then this should, this is, um, ES cell gene targeting should lead to a 404\. Yes, because it should be removed and also I believe that we said to remove this pre-germline characterization.  
49:06  
Oh, it's still here. Hold on, I'm pretty sure we said to remove this one. Hold on. Yes, we said to remove this pre-germline characterization.  
49:26  
So, on these links down here, this one's been removed, it leads to a 404\. This one also has to be removed, pre-germline characterization.  
49:46  
Okay, so remove the link and remove the page. So pretty much like this whole section is going to be removed from this page.  
49:53  
Okay, um, LOXP site design. This image is okay, it's in the other, cell image, but it's alright. It's probably more than 1,500 to be honest, but I guess that's alright.  
50:27  
It just screams that we use ES cells. I mean, like, I can ask Paul, we don't have to not go live, but, because of it, but it does say, Okay, uhm, we'll just keep it for now.  
50:54  
It's on our old site, so, you know, which is something I never thought about, by the way, I'm just speaking out loud now.  
51:02  
I'm wondering if that's been deterring people from submitting quotes, quote requests, like, I never even thought about that. could that be why people are not submitting requests because they see this and think that this is how we do it and they don't want it done that way.  
51:18  
So it's just something to keep in mind. Alright, so here, you have to be very careful for this. Determines the success of conditional knockout.  
51:32  
Proper positioning ensures normal gene functioning before Cree exposure while guaranteeing complete loss. You cannot guarantee anything. So this needs to be edited.  
51:52  
How about proper positioning ensures normal gene function prior to exposure to Cree. Period. period. Proper positioning ensures normal gene function prior to exposal.  
52:09  
What did I say? Exposure. Exposal. Proper positioning ensures normal gene function prior to exposure to Cree.  
52:23  
Period. Okay. That's fine. I guess that's okay. 5kb is a little bit, First Coding Exon, this is, again, like, I hate it when we talk in, like, absolutes.  
53:43  
Look, frameshift guaranteed. No\! Okay. How about First Coding Exon can eliminate all downstream sequence and the possibility of truncated functional proteins.  
54:02  
Period. So, First Coding Exon eliminates, alright, I'm sorry, so it's going to read, can eliminate all downstream sequence and possibility of truncated functional proteins.  
54:45  
That's fine. That's fine. That's fine. Okay. Our scientific team evaluates each gene for remove the word optimal. Our scientific team evaluates each gene for LOXP placement, including Gene Structure Review, Exxon, Essentiality.  
55:22  
Analysis and Frame Shift Verification. I think that we can do, like, some predictive studies for that, so I think that's okay, but just remove the word optimal in there.  
55:32  
Let's remove this, this, uh, question here, should selection cassettes be removed from FOX alleles?  
56:10  
Just remove that completely. Nobody wants to hear about selection cassettes. This last question is fine, it's okay, it's accurate.  
56:49  
Let's look down here now. And this, so TM1A allele design, this needs to be deleted and the page that it links to needs to be deleted.  
57:15  
Okay, and I believe that that is the entire technology section. Thank you.

Hi again, I am going to do the Resources section of the Gene Targeting website. So, I am going to, um, one second here.  
00:15  
Just make sure this is actually a click page. Oops, I am so sorry. I am just jumping around here. Um, I think that that is the main page.  
00:34  
Okay, so now small to resources, let's look to this. That's fine. I don't know about this view all resources. What is this?  
00:55  
Is it like a list? I don't think this clicks. So, this needs to be linked. View all resources. Okay. Um, breeding scheme architect, I understand we're, you know.  
01:15  
I don't know anything about this, so. Punnets, square calculations are up to six. of Leo's like. Like, you probably want this looked over by one of our breeding people to be sure that all of this is our here it.  
01:27  
Um, but I believe that it was reviewed and it was determined that we were going to use it. So downloadable resources.  
01:38  
All the information you need about our animal models in one place for your convenience engineers has created software. Quick guides and charts.  
01:45  
Okay, so here's a thing here. Um, I'll look through these, but. some of that I mean these are all we're not gonna go through this now but updated and in need of edits, um, which I'm not going to go through the edits for the downloadable pages right now.  
02:08  
Um, let's just make sure they all link. Okay, that's, that's what we're gonna do. But really like the thing with this though is that really all of these need to be gone through like after the pages live and just confirmed that they're all still accurate.  
02:26  
We've been meaning to do this for a long time. And we just haven't gotten around. to it. Okay, so it works.  
02:34  
I'm just going through to make sure that these things work essentially. Ugh, it works, but you see it's like kind of, I don't know, is there any way to make it bigger?  
02:45  
This is, this would be a comment like, can we do any better with that image, this humanization comparison chart? Point mutation, they've got a download, so I can't see it.  
03:00  
Same thing with this one in hands with a reporter needs to be downloaded. This one I know needs to be downloaded.  
03:06  
This one I believe has to be downloaded. Yep. I don't know about this one. Does this one? Okay, so pretty much all of these need to be downloaded.  
03:14  
I'm just making sure that it's clicking. Oh, the ingenious pricing guide. Okay, so, I, I thought we were gating this?  
03:22  
I thought we were gating this, and Paul should look through these prices and make sure that they're still accurate. I mean, look, it says academic pricing for commercial pricing.  
03:32  
Please contact us. Price is valid, beginning. 1-1-24. So, I'm gonna make a note, um. Okay, this is my opinion on this.  
04:02  
The Engineer's Pricing Guide, I personally feel like it should be gated. They should have to put in their email address to get our pricing.  
04:07  
I don't know if we're doing that on the rest of our site, but we can ask Paul about that. But personally, I think it should be gated.  
04:13  
And we need to make sure that it's the current version, because right now it says that it's valid, 20-24, and we're in 20-26.  
04:19  
Okay, so that- but to go live, I don't think it's a problem. How many people are gonna actually go to this resources section, but we- that is definitely something that needs to be determined.  
04:28  
We don't have to stop going live for that. but it has to be determined. So this mouse generation guide, this is old.  
04:40  
And probably screams ESLs. Targeting Vector Construction, ESL Targeting, so you know what? I would remove this for now. This mouse model generation step by step, I would just remove this.  
05:02  
Because this needs- this needs a major- major editing, and I can't do that on video, obviously. Um, Um, I'm just curious, do we have a crisper section here?  
05:15  
It talks about timelines. Mmm. Okay, the page doesn't really, I have that much on it. I almost think that it hurts us more than helps us to have this page.  
05:25  
So, I would say yes, up completely remove, um, completely remove that page. Okay? Where were we here? Get back down to it.  
05:38  
Yes. This mouse model generation step by step remove. I think this one is fine. This is gated, I'm pretty sure.  
05:47  
And rat model quick guide is also gated. Alright, let's see what else we have here. White papers, hmm, what's interesting is, Yeah, they're all gated, so I can't see them.  
06:04  
This is just a list of Cree repositories, I think. It's fine. The mouse breeding planer, this is the architect. Is this the mouse model architect?  
06:20  
Yes. Okay. The breeding architect, I guess that's fine. Okay. Okay, make sure that's as you got, is this in here somewhere?  
06:53  
No. So, how do they access this unless they click on that? Oh, this looks fine for me right now. Image block, something has to be done about that.  
07:17  
Okay. There we go. This guide walks you through the key considerations. Alright. Start your project. Okay, I don't know, like, where's the guide?  
08:04  
That's fine. That's fine. This derivative allele system removed this. So what is the derivative allele system? This is, um, the, so where are we here?  
08:21  
We're on the mouse model. Knock out strategy guide. Remove this. Question completely on this page. We don't do this. This is not our technology.  
08:46  
These TM1A, TM1BC, we don't do it. Okay. I mean, you can keep this if you can make an edit here.  
08:58  
Otherwise, I would just remove it. If the knockout was generated using a knockout first allele design, remove this TM1A in here.  
09:07  
If the knockout was generated using a knockout first, um, allele design, yes. Flip recombinase converts, remove that TMA to a conditional ready, remove this TM1C allele.  
09:20  
If the knockout was generated by simple exondilation without the cassette system, a new conditional knockout project would be required. So in this, you just remove these things, this TM1A here, and the parentheses remove TM1A here, and TM1C here.  
09:40  
And then you could probably keep this question. If that's too complicated, I would just remove the question. Okay, related resources, this ESL gene targeting needs to go.  
10:09  
What is this bench-depreating guide? House model budget guide. Okay, it's gone. Let's say I just get rid of it. Okay, yeah, I'd get rid of all that.  
10:26  
And this, yeah. They just, the links just need to be removed from this page. Okay, I'm gonna go back, because now I'm convinced that I'm confused I even got onto that.  
10:35  
Knockout strategy guide. This is probably one of our conventional versus conditional knockout. Let's look at this one. I think that this was from somewhere else, wasn't it?  
10:54  
Was this from technology? Yes, so this one's fine. I already went through this conventional versus conditional versus conventional knockout. If that's what I'm linking through to here.  
11:11  
Yes. We went through it already. I gave you the edits for that already. That's fine. Humanization Strategy Guide. One. All right, let's look at this.  
11:35  
Image. Something has to happen with it. Mmm. Since 1998, Engineering Starting Laboratory has completed over 2,500 custom model projects, kamma including humanized mice kamma with extensive experience, optimizing humanization strategies for diverse therapeutic targets, and research applications.  
12:10  
So that's an edit that needs to be made at the top of this page because I don't know if we've done hundreds.  
12:16  
Well, I mean, I guess if you count CDNA knock-ins, we could just leave it. So just leave it. Including hundreds of humanized mouse development efforts, fine.  
12:37  
That's fine, just leave it. Okay. Okay, the rest of that's fine. Start your project is fine. Okay, frequently asked questions.  
13:13  
One should forward. Alright. Great. It's okay. That's fine. I think that that's fine. I don't know where they get the percentage from, but it could be just BS, but, you know, I imagine that, uh, it's accurate enough.  
14:01  
Because their model could fall in the 40, you know, 20 to 40%, you know what I mean? Alright, this is, this actually might hurt us, so please remove this question.  
14:36  
Can transgenic humanize models be as effective as gene replacement? Can you, can you please just remove that? This is the Humanization Strategy Guide.  
14:48  
Remove Question 3\. Okay? I think that's okay. Alright. That is,fine. Umm, if we're gonna remove some of these pages or edit them, we just need to make sure that they're also removed from the, uhh, whatever this is down here.  
15:33  
Okay, I've gotta go back. Okay, Reporter Selection Guide. I remember going through this originally, and I think that this one was fine, but let's just look at it quick, okay?  
15:44  
Umm, image. Something has to be done. I think this is good. I remember going. Thanks. So, it's fine. We're really down to frequently asked questions.  
16:16  
Okay. Fine. and That's okay. Related resources. I will tell you I did not go through, maybe pulling through these. Let me just see here.  
17:04  
Like, I did not go through GFP mice, TD tomato mice, laxie mice. Let's just click on one of these because I don't remember going through these in the original.  
17:15  
So let's just look at one of them. Alright. Uh, again. image. That's fine. Alright. We do have to be like this page.  
17:45  
These pages, you do have to be a little careful that you're not making promises. Like that, it'll actually fluoresce and you'll see it.  
17:55  
That's fine. Alright, so a lot of these just go to frequently asked questions. And we'll see hmm. I don't know if we can use the iris here.  
18:14  
Let's just go live with it. But I'll ask Paul about that. Like, I don't know if we can say that.  
18:18  
So this is the GFP page. This is the GFP. I'll ask, let's not hold up going live because of that because this is like very buried, okay.  
18:41  
But we might not be able to say that. Mmm. There's more things we can do with this, but let's just leave it like that.  
19:12  
Okay, that's fine. Umm. Okay, that's fine to go live. I'm making a note because there's, there's a way that we can design these that, um, we're not talking about, but we're not gonna not go live because of it.  
19:40  
Let me just look at the TD Tomato one real quick. Maybe I did go through these. Exceptionally bright. I don't, I guess.  
19:53  
That is suggesting that they're going to be able to really see it. I don't think that we can say that.  
20:01  
I don't think that we can say this. Okay. An edit here. Since 1998, Engineers Targeting Laboratory has generated TD Tomato Knockin' Models for, reporting gene expression visualization, cell tracking, and deep tissue imaging.  
20:49  
Let's see if I can say that again. Since 1998, Engineers Targeting Laboratory has generated TD Tomato Knockin' Models for reporting gene expression visualization, cell tracking and deep tissue imaging.  
21:06  
It has to be an edit. Hit. Okay, I think that last paragraph is okay. It's not perfect, but it's okay.  
21:46  
That's fine. For you to only ask questions. I think that's okay to describe it that way. We're not saying it's going to- we're going to make it work that way.  
22:13  
That's fine. Well, let me look here a little bit. Okay. I mean, I'm not promising we're going to be able to do that though.  
22:32  
Okay, and then this is a problem. Like, I don't know if we can say iris. It's the same thing as the last one.  
22:37  
Q3, can we say, A-I-R-E-S. We have another system that we can use, maybe. I don't know if we can say that, but let's not- not go live because of it.  
22:59  
I think that that's fine. Okay. Let's look at, let's look at Laxi really quick. There it is. I think it's okay.  
23:56  
Okay, same thing with the other pages. Umm, Q1 can- And, We say iris. I-R-E-S. But let's not- not go live because of it.  
24:31  
It's fine. Okay, that's fine. Okay. Uhm, I think that we went through a lot of those links. Let's see if we can go back.  
24:51  
Uhm, do I have to go back? I'm like, I'm so off at this point. Let's go back to view all resources because I think that that's where we sort of like went off at the bottom here.  
25:02  
We went through the downloadable and then I started to go through these other resources which was fine. And then I started to go through these guys.  
25:11  
guides, right? I think we went through them all. I did the Creline selection guy to ready. What is this? Climbing guys.  
25:30  
Did we say this is- this is gone? Yes, it's gone, alright. Gone, okay. Yeah, get rid of all that. Mmm, I don't know about these case studies.  
25:58  
yeah these aren't clickable I would just- I would get rid of this right now because, yeah, let's just get rid of this section for now.  
26:08  
The case studies just get rid of it. I mean, these forces, page, get rid of the case studies section. Alright, technical, this should be gone.  
26:30  
Yes. Yes. These we went through already. Pack crossing services, Paul probably went through this one. In his services. Alright, I'm gonna just leave this one for now.  
27:04  
I don't think it's gonna like, ooh. If this is just generic information, it's fine. I think it's okay to keep that.  
27:30  
It's generic, so. Okay. That's fine. Mmm. This, this one. Derivative allele system explained in video library that needs to, that needs to go.  
28:06  
If we have that, we don't want that. This too. ESL targeting process. Get rid of it. Uhm, I don't know if we have these other ones, but just these need to go.  
28:15  
Derivative allele system. Explain ESL targeting process overview. Remove it. Let me just look at this video library really quickly here.  
28:25  
I don't think it clicks. We're just fine, the moment because I don't really know what's in there. Glossary is okay.  
29:01  
Planning guides, model generation, timeline, no. Remove this. We provide comprehensive resources, including selection guides. That's fine. Planning guides and case studies need to go.  
29:12  
Technical resources and FAQs are just in common questions. So just remove. Planning guides. And everything. After it, case studies demonstrating successful project outcomes get rid of that.  
29:26  
And you can leave technical resources. I fake you answering common questions. That's fine. Where can I find case studies? This has to be removed.  
30:12  
And that, that last question is fine. Paul went through these, the genotyping, cryo, phenotyping, and colony management, so I'm not gonna go back through those.  
30:25  
Okay, so for the resources, all resources is fine. Lab signals, um, controls this, but look, we have this, um, some content is blocked for some reason here.  
30:43  
I'm gonna let you, uhh, look through this and just make sure everything is, is linked properly. But other than this not loading right here, it looks fine to me.  
30:59  
Okay, ingenious blog. I'm obviously not gonna go through these, but, you know, it'll just have like a list of all of our old things here.  
31:10  
I mean, the format looks fine. and assuming that you can just like click and oh it goes to it looks maybe like the legacy page, it was fine.  
31:25  
Reading Schimark Attack, we've already talked about this, we're keeping it. I'm assuming that, you know, everybody read through it and made sure that it was accurate enough to use.  
31:34  
The glossary, it should just be like a list of terms which should be fine. Um, it looks good to me.  
31:46  
I'm not gonna look through all of these. is. I'm assuming that they pulled the correct definition from the web. What is this one again?  
31:59  
Did we say, oh, mouse Model Generation Guide, we're removing, I believe we said. Strange backgrounds. I think that we went through this.  
32:22  
I read through this in the original documents. I didn't see any issues with this in the original documents. Yeah, this is fine.  
32:38  
I going through this. Yes, so that one's fine. And the video library. So, okay, so here's the thing. Provides comprehensive resources to researcher, to help researchers design, implement, and optimize from selection guides that clarify strategic decisions to case studies which we don't have.  
33:14  
These resources draw on our expertise. Okay, so, I don't know what the edit should be here, but we don't have case studies.  
33:21  
So. I don't know if we can use some of the language from that past page where I said to remove that, but there was some other language on that last page.  
33:33  
Instead, that I said it was fine to keep. Maybe we can just change it to that. Alright, breathing scheme architect, downloadable resources.  
33:41  
This is all the stuff that we just went through already. Weight papers, other resources. We do have a couple of videos on YouTube that we could potentially look at and add here.  
33:55  
I already went through this on the main resources page and said which ones can be kept, which ones need to be removed pretty much the whole thing needs to be removed.  
34:05  
Planning guides. Case studies need to be removed, we don't have them. Technical resources is fine, but you know, the ESL targeting can go.  
34:24  
Am I not on the right page here, Video Library. We talked about this already. Um, we're not going to do anything with derivative of the wheels or ESL targeting.  
34:33  
Am I on the correct page? Am I on Video Library? Cause this just looks like, uh, a essentially the all resources paid.  
34:41  
Which I am, but there's no videos on here. So we do have a couple of YouTube videos that we may want to add onto this.  
35:12  
Alright, so I will let you, um, find those and work out whether we want to put them on here or not.  
35:19  
And that completes the resources. This section. Thank you. Thank you.
