# Competitor Scientific Diagrams

This folder contains scientific diagrams and infographics downloaded from competitor websites for reference and competitive analysis.

## Purpose

These diagrams are being analyzed to:
1. Understand how competitors visually explain complex genetic engineering processes
2. Identify effective diagram styles and formats
3. Reference for creating improved ITL-branded diagrams
4. Replace overly technical/scientific diagrams on ITL website with clearer alternatives

## Usage Guidelines

### DO:
✅ Use as reference for creating original ITL-branded diagrams
✅ Analyze for clarity, effectiveness, and visual communication
✅ Identify best practices in scientific diagram design
✅ Use concepts to improve ITL educational content

### DON'T:
❌ Use competitor diagrams directly on ITL website without recreating
❌ Copy exact designs without significant modification
❌ Distribute outside the ITL project team
❌ Use for any purpose other than competitive analysis and reference

## Implementation Plan

1. **Analysis Phase** (Current)
   - Downloaded competitor diagrams
   - Documented usage and placement recommendations
   - Identified gaps in ITL's current visual content

2. **Design Phase** (Next)
   - Create ITL-branded versions of effective diagrams
   - Simplify overly technical diagrams for general audiences
   - Design consistent visual language across all diagrams

3. **Implementation Phase**
   - Replace existing diagrams on ITL website
   - Optimize for web performance
   - Ensure accessibility compliance
   - Test responsive behavior

4. **Optimization Phase**
   - A/B test diagram effectiveness
   - Gather user feedback
   - Iterate on designs based on analytics
